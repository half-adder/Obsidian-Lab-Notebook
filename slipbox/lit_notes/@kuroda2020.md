# Author's Abstract
Predicting regulatory potential from primary DNA sequences or transcription factor binding patterns is not possible. However, the annotation of the genome by chromatin proteins, histone modifications, and differential compaction is largely sufficient to reveal the locations of genes and their differential activity states. The Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins are the central players in this cell type–specific chromatin organization. PcG function was originally viewed as being solely repressive and irreversible, as observed at the homeotic loci in flies and mammals. However, it is now clear that modular and reversible PcG function is essential at most developmental genes. Focusing mainly on recent advances, we review evidence for how PcG and TrxG patterns change dynamically during cell type transitions. The ability to implement cell type–specific transcriptional programming with exquisite fidelity is essential for normal development.

# Summary



# Notes

- Originally thought to be irreversibly repressive, PcG function is now understood to be modular & reversible.
- This paper focuses on **dynamics** of PcG and TrxG during cell type transitions
- TrxG
	- Methylates H3K4me2/3 at promoters, H3K4me1 at enhancers \[22\]
	- Ash1 is a primary TrxG methyltranse \[23, 24\]
- PRC2 also deposits H3K27me1/2 \[25-27\]
	- Found at active genes, and also abundantly at intergenic regions
		- Is this evidence for a "sampling" process of PRC2?
	- They speculate intergenic H3K27me might be to protect from aberrant low-level activation
- Self-reinforcing aspects of PcG complexes
	- PRC1 recognizes its own mark (H2Aub) through RYBP subunit \[48\]
	- PRC2 recognizes H2Aub through JARID2 \[52, 53\]
	- PRC1 reognizes H3K27me3 through Pc's chromodomain \[14, 54\]
- PREs
	- Candidate PREs can be identified as strong peaks of PRC1/2 enrichment within broad H3K27me3 domains
	- No single factor is sufficient for PRE function \[64\]

- Instructive & Responsive mechanisms of recruitment
>[!QUOTE]
> Stable silencing through PcG spreading and reinforcement is well established, especially for the early decisions that coordinate the body plan. However, the majority of repression requires reversibility, to allow development to transition through distinct transcriptional programs (92, 93). For all of those regulated loci, how does PcG targeting change with cell type (1, 94)? 
> 
> To date, we are aware of two general classes of models for how cell type–specific patterns of PcG targeting occur (95). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The instructive model posits that combinatorial protein–protein (or protein–noncoding RNA) interactions allow TFs to attract the appropriate members of the PcG or TrxG for regulation in each situation and at each gene.</mark> Supportive evidence for the role of sequence-specific DNA binding factors comes mainly from studies in Drosophila (63), whereas reports of the involvement of noncoding RNAs come from studies in mammalian cells and are still controversial (1). In either case, to have distinct yet specific multivalent interactions at each gene in each cell type is a very complicated scenario in biochemical terms. 
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The responsive model instead relies on a default affinity of PcG-associated proteins for unmethylated CpG islands upstream of mammalian genes, coupled with incompatibility of transcriptional activity with PcG function (95). In this model, PcG and TrxG competitively sample upstreamregulatory sequences,with PcGprevailing at nonexpressed genes but inhibited locally at each expressed gene.Thismodel alleviates the need for the complicated locus-specific interactions required of the instructive model and is supported by the apparent sufficiency of unmethylated DNA of high CpG content to attract PRC2 and H3K27me3 to ectopic, nonexpressed locations (96–99).</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Interestingly, default targeting was also an early model for PcG repression in flies that could explain how PcG maintained silencing of diverse loci that were initially repressed by many different TFs (100, 101).</mark> Although Drosophila genes do not typically have upstream CpG islands, PcG binding is enriched near the 5' transcription start sites in flies, similar to PcG binding in mammals (102). Further, in Drosophila, at least for the canonical Polycomb target genes such as the Hox loci, early TFs set the ON or OFF state of the gene. Transcriptional activity then determines whether Polycomb or Trithorax prevails to maintain the transcription state. 
> 
> Although flies and mammals may have diverged considerably in their mechanisms of PcG targeting at the 5' ends of genes, the conservation of the protein complexes, enzymatic functions, and unexpected localization of PRC1 on active genes (discussed below) suggests there could still be unifying concepts to be discovered.
