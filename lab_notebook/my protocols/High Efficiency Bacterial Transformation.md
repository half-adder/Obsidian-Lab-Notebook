1.  Thaw cells.
	1. For C2987H: Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent _E. coli_ cells on ice for 10 minutes.
	2. For C2987I: Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent _E. coli_ cells on ice until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µl of cells into a transformation tube on ice.
2.  Add 1-5 µl containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. **Do not vortex.**
	1. 
3.  Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
4.  Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
5.  Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
6.  Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
7.  Place at 37°C for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.
8.  Warm selection plates to 37°C.
9.  Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting, then perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in SOC.
10.  Spread 50-100 µl of each dilution onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 37°C. Alternatively, incubate at 30°C for 24-36 hours or 25°C for 48 hours.
