  abstract = {Abstract   Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the majority of ubiquitin incorporation at the C-terminus of histone H2A (H2A) (lysines 118/119). Accordingly, PRC1 ligase function has been the subject of recent biochemical and structural studies. The E3 activity resides in a heterodimer of Really interesting new gene (RING) domains. One of these RINGs is present at the N-terminus of the Ring1 subunit and is the catalytically active, E2-binding RING. The second, ``inactive'' RING is present in the N-terminus of one of six (in human) Polycomb group (PcG) RING Finger (PCGF)-family subunits. The PCGF RING both stabilizes the active RING and influences nucleosome substrate binding and activity of the heterodimer. While biochemical aspects of ligase function are now reasonably clear, much ongoing work is focused on understanding which of the PRC1 variants (canonical or noncanonical) is most important in introducing this mark to target loci and on better defining the biological function of H2A ubiquitination.}

  abstract = {Covalent attachment of ubiquitin residue is not only the proteasomal degradation signal, but also a widespread posttranslational modification of cellular proteins in eukaryotes. One of the most important targets of the regulatory ubiquitination are histones. Localization of ubiquitin residue in different regions of the nucleosome attracts a strictly determined set of cellular factors with varied functionality. Depending on the type of histone and the particular lysine residue undergoing modification, histone ubiquitination can lead both to transcription activation and to gene repression, as well as contribute to DNA repair via different mechanisms. An extremely interesting feature of the family of RING E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyzing histone ubiquitination is the striking structural diversity of the domains providing high specificity of modification very similar initial targets. It is obvious that further elucidation of peculiarities of the ubiquitination system involved in histone modification, as well as understanding of physiological role of this process in the maintenance of homeostasis of both single cells and the entire organism, will substantially expand the possibilities of treating a number of socially significant diseases.}

  abstract = {Patterned expression of many developmental genes is specified by transcription factor gene expression, but is thought to be refined by chromatin-mediated repression. Regulatory DNA sequences called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are required to repress some developmental target genes, and are widespread in genomes, suggesting that they broadly affect developmental programs. While PREs in transgenes can nucleate trimethylation on lysine 27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3), none have been demonstrated to be necessary at endogenous chromatin domains. This failure is thought to be due to the fact that most endogenous H3K27me3 domains contain many PREs, and individual PREs may be redundant. In contrast to these ideas, we show here that PREs near the wing selector gene vestigial have distinctive roles at their endogenous locus, even though both PREs are repressors in transgenes. First, a PRE near the promoter is required for vestigial activation and not for repression. Second, only the distal PRE contributes to H3K27me3, but even removal of both PREs does not eliminate H3K27me3 across the vestigial domain. Thus, endogenous chromatin domains appear to be intrinsically marked by H3K27me3, and PREs appear required to enhance this chromatin modification to high levels at inactive genes.},

In certain cases development can be reversed or redirected by mis-expression of master regulator transcription factors. This must involve the activation of previously silenced genes, and such developmental aberrations are thought to underlie a variety of cancers. Here, we express the wing-specific Vestigial master regulator to reprogram the developing eye, and test the role of silencing in reprogramming using an H3.3K27M oncohistone mutation that dominantly inhibits histone H3K27 trimethylation. We find that production of the oncohistone blocks eye-to-wing reprogramming. CUT\&Tag chromatin profiling of mutant tissues shows that H3K27me3 of domains is generally reduced upon oncohistone production, suggesting that a previous developmental program must be silenced for effective transformation. Strikingly, Vg and H3.3K27M synergize to stimulate overgrowth of eye tissue, a phenotype that resembles that of mutations in Polycomb silencing components. Transcriptome profiling of elongating RNA Polymerase II implicates the mis-regulation of signaling factors in overgrowth. Our results demonstrate that growth dysregulation can result from the simple combination of crippled silencing and transcription factor mis-expression, an effect that may explain the origins of oncohistone-bearing cancers.},

These interactions are especially important in development as gene expression programs change. Chromatin generally limits the accessibility of DNA, and thus exposing sequences at regulatory elements is critical for gene expression. However, it is challenging to understand how transcription factors manipulate chromatin structure and the sequence of regulatory events. The Drosophila embryo has provided a powerful setting to directly observe the establishment and elaboration of chromatin features and experimentally test the causality of transcriptional events that are shared among many metazoans. The large embryo is tractable by live imaging, and a variety of well-developed tools allow the manipulation of factors during early development. The early embryo develops as a syncytium with rapid nuclear divisions and no zygotic transcription, with largely featureless chromatin. Thus, studies in this system have revealed the progression of genome activation triggered by pioneer factors that initiate DNA exposure at regulatory elements and the establishment of chromatin domains, including heterochromatin, the nucleolus, and nuclear bodies. The de novo emergence of nuclear structures in the early embryo reveals features of chromatin dynamics that are likely to be central to transcriptional regulation in all cells.},

Using a recently described PcG reporter fly line, we observed a strong reporter inducibility in the embryo and its sharp decrease in larval and adult stages. Analysis of the chromatin landscape of the reporter revealed a strong signal for the repressive PcG mark, H3K27me3, in all three developmental stages and, surprisingly, a strong signal for a transcriptionally activating H3K4me3 mark in the embryo. Using re-chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, bivalent domains were also uncovered at endogenous PcG targets like the Hox genes.},

Here we combine nascent chromatin capture (NCC) and triple-SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) labeling to track histone modifications and histone variants during DNA replication and across the cell cycle. We show that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are transmitted with parental histones to newly replicated DNA. Di- and trimethylation marks are diluted twofold upon DNA replication, as a consequence of new histone deposition. Importantly, within one cell cycle, all PTMs are restored. In general, new histones are modified to mirror the parental histones. However, H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3 are propagated by continuous modification of parental and new histones because the establishment of these marks extends over several cell generations. Together, our results reveal how histone marks propagate and demonstrate that chromatin states oscillate within the cell cycle.},

PcG complexes modify chromatin, but also interact with both RNA and DNA, and RNA is implicated in PcG targeting and function. Here we show that R-loops form at many PREs in Drosophila embryos, and correlate with repressive states. In vitro, both PRC1 and PRC2 can recognize R-loops and open DNA bubbles. Unexpectedly, we find that PRC2 drives formation of RNA-DNA hybrids, the key component of R-loops, from RNA and dsDNA.

How different PcG proteins assemble into complexes and are recruited to their target genes is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the core of the Drosophila PcG protein complex Pleiohomeotic (Pho)-repressive complex (PhoRC), which contains the Polycomb response element (PRE)-binding protein Pho and Sfmbt. The spacer region of Pho, separated from the DNA-binding domain by a long flexible linker, forms a tight complex with the four malignant brain tumor (4MBT) domain of Sfmbt. The highly conserved spacer region of the human Pho ortholog YY1 binds three of the four human 4MBT domain proteins in an analogous manner but with lower affinity. Comparison of the Drosophila Pho:Sfmbt and human YY1:MBTD1 complex structures provides a molecular explanation for the lower affinity of YY1 for human 4MBT domain proteins. Structure-guided mutations that disrupt the interaction between Pho and Sfmbt abolish formation of a ternary Sfmbt:Pho:DNA complex in vitro and repression of developmental regulator genes in Drosophila. PRE tethering of Sfmbt by Pho is therefore essential for Polycomb repression in Drosophila. Our results support a model where DNA tethering of Sfmbt by Pho and multivalent interactions of Sfmbt with histone modifications and other PcG proteins create a hub for PcG protein complex assembly at PREs.},

First, following initial repression of target genes by gene-specific transcription factors, PcG proteins recognize the repressed state and assume control of the genes' repression. Second, once the silenced state is established, PcG proteins may maintain repression through an indefinite number of cell cycles. Little is understood about how PcG proteins initially recognize the repressed state of target genes and the steps leading to de novo establishment of PcG-mediated repression. We describe a genetic system in which a Drosophila PcG target gene, giant (gt), is ubiquitously repressed during early embryogenesis by a maternally expressed transcription factor, and show the temporal recruitment of components of three PcG protein complexes: PhoRC, PRC1 and PRC2. We show that de novo PcG recruitment follows a temporal hierarchy in which PhoRC stably localizes at the target gene at least 1 h before stable recruitment of PRC2 and concurrent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The presence of PRC2 and increased levels of H3K27me3 are found to precede stable binding by PRC1.},

However, in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that it can interfere with endocrine signaling pathways at low doses during fetal, neonatal or perinatal periods as well as in adulthood. In addition, mounting evidence suggests a variety of pathways through which BPA can elicit cellular responses at very low concentrations with the same or even higher efficiency than E2.

Imaging chromatin in live Drosophila larvae, with preserved nuclear volume, revealed that active and repressed chromatin separates from the nuclear interior and forms a peripheral layer underneath the nuclear lamina. This is in contrast to the current view that chromatin distributes throughout the nucleus. Furthermore, peripheral chromatin organization was observed in distinct Drosophila tissues, as well as in live human effector T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Lamin A/C up-regulation resulted in chromatin collapse toward the nuclear center and correlated with a significant reduction in the levels of active chromatin. Physical modeling suggests that binding of lamina-associated domains combined with chromatin self-attractive interactions recapitulate the experimental chromatin distribution profiles. Together, our findings reveal a novel mode of mesoscale organization of peripheral chromatin sensitive to lamina composition, which is evolutionary conserved.

Here, pure chromatin templates assembled with varied combinations of recombinant wild-type and mutant core histones have been employed to ascertain the role of individual histone tails, both in overall acetylation patterns and in transcription. In vitro assays show an indispensable role for H3 and H4 tails, especially major lysine substrates, in p300-dependent transcriptional activation, as well as activator-targeted acetylation of promoter-proximal histone tails by p300. These results indicate, first, that constraints to transcription are imposed by nucleosomal histone components other than histone N-terminal tails and, second, that the histone N-terminal tails have selective roles, which can be modulated by targeted acetylation, in transcriptional activation by p300.},

Although diverse methodologies have been developed to identify enhancers and promoters, most have tacitly assumed that these elements are distinct.

Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-mutually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Multicellular organisms depend on the precise orchestration of gene expression to direct embryonic development and to maintain tissue homeostasis through their life spans. Exactly how such cell type\textendash specific patterns of gene expression are established, maintained, and passed on to the next generation is one of the most fundamental questions of biology. Eukaryotes package their DNA into nucleosomes to form chromatin fibers. Chromatin plays a central role in regulating accessibility to DNA in many different DNA templated processes, including machineries that transcribe DNA into RNA, i.e., transcription. Transcriptional control through sequence-specific DNA binding factors (transcription factors) is well established; however, proteins that change chromatin structure (chromatin modifiers and remodelers) provide an additional layer of regulation and are considered major epigenetic determinants of cell identity and function. Among the numerous chromatin modifiers, the members of the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, in particular, have been scrutinized genetically and biochemically for decades. However, new and unexpected functions for these complexes are constantly emerging because of the intense interest in the critical role these proteins play in maintaining a balanced state of gene expression.  ADVANCES  In the classical view, PcG and TrxG proteins regulate the repressed and activated states of gene expression, respectively. Both PcG and TrxG are organized in multiprotein complexes, which include the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2, respectively), and the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family. Polycomb and COMPASS families are well known for their opposing roles in balancing gene expression, a phenomenon initially characterized using classical  Drosophila melanogaster  genetic approaches at a time when their biochemical functions were still unknown. Later studies demonstrated that Polycomb and COMPASS complexes have enzymatic activities modifying different sites on a common target, the nucleosome. Nucleosomes can be posttranslationally modified in a variety of ways, many of which strongly correlate with different states of gene expression. Through their ability to regulate gene expression, several components of both the Polycomb and COMPASS complexes are involved in a plethora of crucial biological processes ranging from the regulation of embryonic development to widespread involvement in neoplastic pathogenesis.   OUTLOOK  Recent genome-wide studies have demonstrated that a large number of the components of the Polycomb and COMPASS families are often mutated in different forms of cancer. Some mutations result in gene deletion or early termination, such as loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, whereas gain-of-function (GOF) mutations increase or change their normal activities. Although it cannot be excluded that some of those are passenger rather than driver mutations, they suggest a relevant function of these proteins in tumorigenesis. Moreover, animal models have provided convincing evidence supporting a role for these complexes in tumor progression. However, even after decades of study, how Polycomb and COMPASS control normal or aberrant gene regulatory networks is not fully understood yet. From the perspective of their catalytic activities, the degree to which catalytic versus noncatalytic functions contribute to their roles in development and cancer has just begun to emerge. Concurrently, the possibility that PcG and TrxG enzymatic activities modify non-nucleosome substrates remains a fascinating, although largely unexplored, hypothesis. Ongoing efforts to decipher how mutations affecting members of these complexes disturb transcriptional balances and promote oncogenesis could provide critically needed new strategies for cancer therapeutics.}

  abstract = {More than 80years ago, the first Polycomb-related phenotype was identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Later, a group of diverse genes collectively called Polycomb group (PcG) genes were identified based on common mutant phenotypes. PcG proteins, which are well-conserved in animals, were originally characterized as negative regulators of gene transcription during development and subsequently shown to function in various biological processes; their deregulation is associated with diverse phenotypes in development and in disease, especially cancer. PcG proteins function on chromatin and can form two distinct complexes with different enzymatic activities: Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is a histone ubiquitin ligase and PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase. Recent studies have revealed the existence of various mutually exclusive PRC1 and PRC2 variants. In this Review, we discuss new concepts concerning the biochemical and molecular functions of these new PcG complex variants, and how their epigenetic activities are involved in mammalian development and cancer. The histone modifiers Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 have important roles in development and disease, especially cancer. Recent studies have revealed the existence of various mutually exclusive PRC1 and PRC2 variants, and provided new insights into their molecular functions and physiological importance.}

PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1\textendash PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1). For chromatin recruitment, the PCGF6 complex requires the combinatorial activities of its MGA-MAX and E2F6-DP1 subunits, while PCGF3 requires an interaction with the USF1 DNA binding transcription factor.}

  abstract = {BMI1 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a key role in maintaining epigenetic silencing during development. BMI1 also participates in gene silencing during DNA damage response, but the precise downstream function of BMI1 in gene silencing is unclear. Here we identified the UBR5 E3 ligase as a downstream factor of BMI1. We found that UBR5 forms damage-inducible nuclear foci in a manner dependent on the PRC1 components BMI1, RNF1 (RING1a), and RNF2 (RING1b). Whereas transcription is repressed at UV-induced lesions on chromatin, depletion of the PRC1 members or UBR5 alone derepressed transcription elongation at these sites, suggesting that UBR5 functions in a linear pathway with PRC1 in inducing gene silencing at lesions. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that UBR5 associates with BMI1 as well as FACT components SPT16 and SSRP1. We found that UBR5 localizes to the UV-induced lesions along with SPT16. We show that UBR5 ubiquitinates SPT16, and depletion of UBR5 or BMI1 leads to an enlargement of SPT16 foci size at UV lesions, suggesting that UBR5 and BMI1 repress SPT16 enrichment at the damaged sites. Consistently, depletion of the FACT components effectively reversed the transcriptional derepression incurred in the UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells. Finally, UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells are hypersensitive to UV, which supports the notion that faulty RNA synthesis at damaged sites is harmful to the cell fitness. Altogether, these results suggest that BMI1 and UBR5 repress the polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription at damaged sites, by negatively regulating the FACT-dependent Pol II elongation.}

BRM was identified as a transcriptional activator of Hox genes required for the specification of body segment identities. To clarify the role of the BRM complex in the transcription of other genes, we examined its distribution on larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The BRM complex is associated with nearly all transcriptionally active chromatin in a pattern that is generally non-overlapping with that of Polycomb, a repressor of Hox gene transcription. Reduction of BRM function dramatically reduces the association of RNA polymerase II with salivary gland chromosomes. A few genes, such as induced heat shock loci, are not associated with the BRM complex; transcription of these genes is not compromised by loss of BRM function. The distribution of the BRM complex thus correlates with a dependence on BRM for gene activity. These data suggest that the chromatin remodeling activity of the BRM complex plays a general role in facilitating transcription by RNA polymerase II.},

To assess a possible role for H3K4me1 in dictating gene regulatory states at promoters, we examined H3K4me1 peak density around promoters in human and mouse germ cells using an analytic strategy that allowed us to assess relationships between different epigenetic marks on a promoter-by-promoter basis. We found that H3K4me1 exhibits either a bimodal pattern at active promoters, where it flanks H3K4me3, or a unimodal pattern at poised promoters, where it coincides with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. This pattern is correlated with gene expression level, but is more strongly linked to a poised chromatin state, defined by the simultaneous presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, than to transcriptional activity. The pattern is especially prominent in germ cells, but is also present in other cell types, including embryonic stem cells and differentiated somatic cells. We propose that H3K4me1 is a key feature of the poised epigenetic state, and suggest possible roles for this mark in epigenetic memory.},

This enables us to compute expression maps for all detected genes in the wing disc and to discover 824 genes with spatially restricted expression patterns. This approach identifies clusters of genes with similar expression patterns and functional relevance. As proof of concept, we characterize the previously unstudied gene CG5151 and show that it regulates Wnt signaling.

Here we critically assess the current knowledge regarding H2Aub deposition and removal, its crosstalk with PcG repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone H3K27 methylation, and the recent attempts toward discovering its readers and solving its enigmatic functions.

To understand why some sequences evolve faster than others in a single cis-regulatory locus, we investigated function and evolutionary dynamics of the promoter of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-47 gene. We found that this promoter consists of two distinct domains. The proximal promoter is conserved and is largely sufficient to direct appropriate spatial expression. The distal promoter displays little if any conservation between several closely related nematodes. Despite this divergence, sequences from all species confer robustness of expression, arguing that this function does not require substantial sequence conservation. We showed that even unrelated sequences have the ability to promote robust expression. A prominent feature shared by all of these robustness-promoting sequences is an AT-enriched nucleotide composition consistent with nucleosome depletion. Because general sequence composition can be maintained despite sequence turnover, our results explain how different functional constraints can lead to vastly disparate rates of sequence divergence within a promoter.},

Quantitative live imaging and targeted genome editing demonstrate that this two-tiered organization is critical for the precise temporal dynamics of Hox gene transcription during development. Tethering elements mediate long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and foster fast activation kinetics. Conversely, the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) prevent spurious interactions with enhancers and silencers located in neighboring TADs. These two levels of genome organization operate independently of one another to ensure precision of transcriptional dynamics and the reliability of complex patterning processes.},

Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by Cheung et al.). Parvanov et al. (p. 835, published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas Myers et al. (p. 876, published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome. Baudat et al. (p. 836, published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species. Meiotic recombination events cluster into narrow segments of the genome, defined as hotspots. Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome. A chromatin-modifying enzyme is implicated in the determination of recombination loci within the genome.

Here, we review key discoveries resulting from investigations of these epithelial precursor organs, ranging from cell fate determination and transdetermination to tissue patterning. Furthermore, the design of increasingly sophisticated genetic tools over the last decades has added value to the use of imaginal discs as model systems. As a result of tissue-specific genetic screens, several components of developmentally regulated signaling pathways were identified and epistasis revealed the levels at which they function. Discs have been widely used to assess cellular interactions in their natural tissue context, contributing to a better understanding of growth regulation, tissue regeneration, and cancer. With the continuous implementation of novel tools, imaginal discs retain significant potential as model systems to address emerging questions in biology and medicine.},

Much of what we know about the pathway was learned from genetic and molecular experiments in Drosophila melanogaster, and the core pathway works the same way in vertebrates. Like most growth factor pathways, extracellular Wingless/Wnt binds to a cell surface complex to transduce signal across the plasma membrane, triggering a series of intracellular events that lead to transcriptional changes in the nucleus. Unlike most growth factor pathways, the intracellular events regulate the protein stability of a key effector molecule, in this case Armadillo/{$\beta$}-catenin. A number of mysteries remain about how the ``destruction complex'' destabilizes {$\beta$}-catenin and how this process is inactivated by the ligand-bound receptor complex, so this review of the field can only serve as a snapshot of the work in progress.},

PRC2 is primarily associated with CpG islands at repressed genes and also possesses RNA binding activity. However, the RNAs that bind PRC2 in cells, the subunits that mediate these interactions, and the role of RNA in PRC2 recruitment to chromatin all remain unclear. By performing iCLIP for PRC2 in comparison with other RNA binding proteins, we show here that PRC2 binds nascent RNA at essentially all active genes. Although interacting with RNA promiscuously, PRC2 binding is enriched at specific locations within RNAs, primarily exon\textendash intron boundaries and the 3{${'}$} UTR. Deletion of other PRC2 subunits reveals that SUZ12 is sufficient to establish this RNA binding profile. Contrary to prevailing models, we also demonstrate that the interaction of PRC2 with RNA or chromatin is mutually antagonistic in cells and in vitro. RNA degradation in cells triggers PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands at active genes. Correspondingly, the release of PRC2 from chromatin in cells increases RNA binding. Consistent with this, RNA and nucleosomes compete for PRC2 binding in vitro. We propose that RNA prevents PRC2 recruitment to chromatin at active genes and that mutual antagonism between RNA and chromatin underlies the pattern of PRC2 chromatin association across the genome.},

It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve the reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this is poorly understood. The predominant model involves physical enhancer-promoter interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. However, studying the enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our data suggest that models of enhancer-promoter communication need to encompass chromatin conformations other than looping.},

We then show that by encoding such signals into a single input, expression mean and variability can be independently tuned. Further, we construct a light-responsive promoter library and demonstrate how pulsatile signaling also enables graded multi-gene regulation at fixed expression ratios, despite differences in promoter dose-response characteristics. Pulsatile regulation can thus lead to beneficial functional behaviors in synthetic biological systems, which previously required laborious optimization of genetic parts or the construction of synthetic gene networks.},

  abstract = {Genes targeted by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are regulated in cis by chromatin modifications and also in trans by diffusible regulators such as transcription factors. Here, we introduce a mathematical model in which transcription directly antagonizes Polycomb silencing, thereby linking these cis- and trans-regulatory inputs to gene expression. The model is parameterized by recent experimental data showing that PRC2-mediated repressive chromatin modifications accumulate extremely slowly. The model generates self-perpetuating, bistable active and repressed chromatin states that persist through DNA replication, thereby ensuring high-fidelity transmission of the current chromatin state. However, sufficiently strong, persistent activation or repression of transcription promotes switching between active and repressed chromatin states. We observe that when chromatin modification dynamics are slow, transient pulses of transcriptional activation or repression are effectively filtered, such that epigenetic memory is retained. Noise filtering thus depends on slow chromatin dynamics and may represent an important function of PRC2-based regulation.},

To comprehensively identify coding sequences, we constructed a series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays representing sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the human genome. Transcribed sequences were located across the genome via hybridization to complementary DNA samples, reverse-transcribed from polyadenylated RNA obtained from human liver tissue. In addition to identifying many known and predicted genes, we found 10,595 transcribed sequences not detected by other methods. A large fraction of these are located in intergenic regions distal from previously annotated genes and exhibit significant homology to other mammalian proteins. A comprehensive search for transcribed sequences from both strands of the entire human genome has identified known genes and thousands of potential new ones.

  abstract = {Ligand-dependent transcription by the nuclear receptor glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is mediated by interactions with coregulators. The role of these interactions in determining selective binding of GR to regulatory elements remains unclear. Recent findings indicate that a large fraction of genomic GR binding coincides with chromatin that is accessible prior to hormone treatment, suggesting that receptor binding is dictated by proteins that maintain chromatin in an open state. Combining DNaseI accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing, we identify the activator protein 1 (AP1) as a major partner for productive GR-chromatin interactions. AP1 is critical for GR-regulated transcription and recruitment to co-occupied regulatory elements, illustrating an extensive AP1-GR interaction network. Importantly, the maintenance of baseline chromatin accessibility facilitates GR recruitment and is dependent on AP1 binding. We propose a model in which the basal occupancy of transcription factors acts to prime chromatin and direct inducible transcription factors to select regions in the genome.},

However, the regulation of its expression during wing development is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed ap transcriptional regulation at the endogenous locus and identified three cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) essential for wing development. Only when the three CRMs are combined, robust ap expression is obtained. In addition, we genetically and molecularly analyzed the trans-factors that regulate these CRMs. Our results propose a three-step mechanism for the cell lineage compartment expression of ap that includes initial activation, positive autoregulation and Trithorax-mediated maintenance through separable CRMs.},

Su(z)12 mutants exhibit very strong homeotic transformations and Su(z)12 function is required throughout development to maintain the repressed state of HOX genes. Unlike most other PcG mutations, Su(z)12 mutations are strong suppressors of position-effect variegation (PEV), suggesting that Su(z)12 also functions in heterochromatin-mediated repression. Furthermore, Su(z)12 function is required for germ cell development. The Su(z)12 protein is highly conserved in vertebrates and is related to the Arabidopsis proteins EMF2, FIS2 and VRN2. Notably, EMF2 is a repressor of floral homeotic genes. These results suggest that at least some of the regulatory machinery that controls homeotic gene expression is conserved between animals and plants.},

These features, called CpG islands, were identified over 20 years ago, but there remains little mechanistic evidence to suggest how these enigmatic elements contribute to promoter function, except that they are refractory to epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36-specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements results in removal of H3K36 methylation, creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modification. KDM2A utilizes a zinc finger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that preferentially recognizes nonmethylated CpG DNA, and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands. These data expose a straightforward mechanism through which KDM2A delineates a unique architecture that differentiates CpG island chromatin from bulk chromatin.},

Recruitment of PRC1 to target sites has been proposed to occur through a hierarchical process, dependent on~prior nucleation of PRC2 and placement of H3K27me3. Here, using a de novo targeting assay in mouse embryonic stem cells we unexpectedly discover that PRC1-dependent H2AK119ub1 leads to recruitment of PRC2 and H3K27me3 to effectively initiate a polycomb domain. This activity is restricted to variant PRC1 complexes, and genetic ablation experiments reveal that targeting of the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex by KDM2B to CpG islands is required for normal polycomb domain formation and mouse development. These observations provide a surprising PRC1-dependent logic for PRC2 occupancy at target sites in~vivo.},

Despite being extensively studied, how the Polycomb system selects its target genes is poorly understood, and whether its histone-modifying activities are required for transcriptional repression remains controversial. Here, we directly test the requirement for PRC1 catalytic activity in Polycomb system function. To achieve this, we develop a conditional mutation system in embryonic stem cells that completely removes PRC1 catalytic activity. Using this system, we demonstrate that catalysis by PRC1 drives Polycomb chromatin domain formation and long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show that variant PRC1 complexes with DNA-binding activities occupy target sites independently of PRC1 catalytic activity, providing a putative mechanism for Polycomb target site selection. Finally, we discover that Polycomb-mediated gene repression requires PRC1 catalytic activity. Together these discoveries provide compelling evidence that PRC1 catalysis is central to Polycomb system function and gene regulation.},

Although ultimately gene expression relies on DNA-binding transcription factors to guide the activity of the transcription machinery to genes, it has also become clear that chromatin and histone post-translational modification have fundamental roles in gene regulation. Polycomb repressive complexes represent a paradigm of chromatin-based gene regulation in animals. The Polycomb repressive system comprises two central protein complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2, which are essential for normal gene regulation and development. Our early understanding of Polycomb function relied on studies in simple model organisms, but more recently it has become apparent that this system has expanded and diverged in mammals. Detailed studies are now uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable mammalian PRC1 and PRC2 to identify their target sites in the genome, communicate through feedback mechanisms to create Polycomb chromatin domains and control transcription to regulate gene expression. In this Review, we discuss and contextualize the emerging principles that define how this fascinating chromatin-based system regulates gene expression in mammals.},

Measuring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding at 20~min intervals over the course of ZGA reveals that the checkpoint coincides with widespread de novo recruitment of Pol II that precedes and does not require a functional checkpoint. This recruitment drives slowing or stalling of DNA replication at transcriptionally engaged loci. Reducing Pol II recruitment in zelda mutants both reduces replication stalling and bypasses the requirement for a functional checkpoint. This suggests a model where the checkpoint functions as a feedback mechanism to remodel the cell cycle in response to nascent ZGA.},

We find that regions of accessibility are established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in advance of promoters and insulators. These open states are stably maintained in highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of the MBT. In general, acquisition of promoter accessibility is controlled by the biological timer that measures the nucleo-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, whereas timing of enhancer accessibility is regulated independently of the N:C ratio. These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA.},

  abstract = {The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1, PRC2, and PR-DUB repress target genes by modifying their chromatin. In Drosophila, PRC1 compacts chromatin and monoubiquitinates histone H2A at lysine 118 (H2Aub1), whereas PR-DUB is a major H2Aub1 deubiquitinase, but how H2Aub1 levels must be balanced for Polycomb repression remains unclear. We show that in early embryos, H2Aub1 is enriched at Polycomb target genes, where it facilitates H3K27me3 deposition by PRC2 to mark genes for repression. During subsequent stages of development, H2Aub1 becomes depleted from these genes and is no longer enriched when Polycomb maintains them repressed. Accordingly, Polycomb targets remain repressed in H2Aub1-deficient animals. In PR-DUB catalytic mutants, high levels of H2Aub1 accumulate at Polycomb target genes, and Polycomb repression breaks down. These high H2Aub1 levels do not diminish Polycomb protein complex binding or H3K27 trimethylation but increase DNA accessibility. We show that H2Aub1 interferes with nucleosome stacking and chromatin fiber folding in vitro. Consistent with this, Polycomb repression defects in PR-DUB mutants are exacerbated by reducing PRC1 chromatin compaction activity, but Polycomb repression is restored if PRC1 E3 ligase activity is removed. PR-DUB therefore acts as a rheostat that removes excessive H2Aub1 that, although deposited by PRC1, antagonizes PRC1-mediated chromatin compaction.},

SCM protein contains a C-terminal domain, termed the SPM domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions. The biochemical function of another domain consisting of two 100-amino-acid-long repeats, termed ``mbt'' repeats, is unknown. We have determined the molecular lesions of nine Scm mutant alleles, which identify functional requirements for specific domains. The Scm alleles were tested for genetic interactions with mutations in other PcG genes. Intriguingly, three hypomorphic Scm mutations, which map within an mbt repeat, interact with PcG mutations more strongly than do Scm null alleles. The strongest interactions produce partial synthetic lethality that affects doubly heterozygous females more severely than males. We show that mbt repeat alleles produce stable SCM proteins that associate with normal sites in polytene chromosomes. We also analyzed progeny from Scm mutant germline clones to compare the effects of an mbt repeat mutation during embryonic vs. pupal development. We suggest that the mbt repeat alleles produce altered SCM proteins that incorporate into and impair function of PcG protein complexes.},

Using this method in cultured S2R+ cells, we efficiently tagged four endogenous proteins with the bright fluorescent protein mNeonGreen, thereby demonstrating that an existing collection of CRISPaint universal donor plasmids is compatible with insect cells. In addition, we inserted the transgenesis marker 3xP3-red fluorescent protein into seven genes in the fly germ line, producing heritable loss-of-function alleles that were isolated by simple fluorescence screening. Unlike in cultured cells, insertions/deletions always occurred at the genomic insertion site, which prevents predictably matching the insert coding frame to the target gene. Despite this effect, we were able to isolate T2A-Gal4 insertions in four genes that serve as in vivo expression reporters. Therefore, homology-independent insertion in Drosophila is a fast and simple alternative to HDR that will enable researchers to dissect gene function.},

By expressing prime editing components in cultured cells or somatic cells of transgenic flies, we precisely introduce premature stop codons in three classical visible marker genes, ebony, white, and forked.

Here, we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex, which is mutated in over 20\% of human tumors, interacts with EWSR1, a member of a family of proteins with prion-like domains (PrLD) that are frequent partners in oncogenic fusions with transcription factors. In Ewing sarcoma, we find that the BAF complex is recruited by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein to tumor-specific enhancers and contributes to target gene activation. This process is a neomorphic property of EWS-FLI1 compared to wild-type FLI1 and depends on tyrosine residues that are necessary for phase transitions of the EWSR1 prion-like domain. Furthermore, fusion of short fragments of EWSR1 to FLI1 is sufficient to recapitulate BAF complex retargeting and EWSFLI1 activities. Our studies thus demonstrate that the physical properties of prion-like domains can retarget critical chromatin regulatory complexes to establish and maintain oncogenic gene expression programs.},

Expression of these genes is governed by cis-regulatory domains, one for each parasegment. Stable repression of these domains depends on Polycomb Group (PcG) functions, which include trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). To search for parasegment-specific signatures that reflect PcG function, chromatin from single parasegments was isolated and profiled. The H3K27me3 profiles across the BX-C in successive parasegments showed a `stairstep' pattern that revealed sharp boundaries of the BX-C regulatory domains. Acetylated H3K27 was broadly enriched across active domains, in a pattern complementary to H3K27me3. The CCCTC-binding protein (CTCF) bound the borders between H3K27 modification domains; it was retained even in parasegments where adjacent domains lack H3K27me3. These findings provide a molecular definition of the homeotic domains, and implicate precisely positioned H3K27 modifications as a central determinant of segment identity.},

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure1. PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development2,3,4,5,6 and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency2, but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys\,27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Our results indicate that dynamic repression of developmental pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development.},

In this review, it is argued that the relationship between the accessibility and activity of an enhancer is insufficiently described by simply considering open versus closed chromatin, or active versus inactive enhancers. Instead, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states. While the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. Molecular mechanisms that may account for these quantitative differences are discussed. A model that relates molecular events at an enhancer to changes in its activity and accessibility in a developing tissue is also proposed.},

The maternal germ-line dependent expression of each of these genes is assessed by comparison of zygotes from mothers whose functional germ cells carry no wild-type alleles to zygotes from mothers whose germ cells contain one wild-type allele. Because mutant alleles of each of the genes studied are recessive lethals, mosaic females with homozygous or hemizygous mutant germ lines were produced by pole cell transplantation. The results demonstrate that all of the negative regulators tested are expressed in the maternal germ line and all play important roles in the regulation of BX-C activities during embryogenesis. The absence of maternally supplied products from all of the genes studied except l(4)29 can be largely or completely compensated for by the activity in the zygote of a paternally contributed wild-type allele. It is argued that, with the exception of l(4)29, the genes studied in this report are qualitatively similar in function to the previously described BX-C regulators Pc, esc, and sxc. The available evidence indicates that genes within this group have functions that are not restricted to the regulation of genes that control segmental identity.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group proteins (PcG) repress homeotic genes in cells where these genes must remain inactive during Drosophila and vertebrate development. This repression depends on cis-acting silencer sequences, called Polycomb group response elements (PREs). Pleiohomeotic (Pho), the only known sequence-specific DNA-binding PcG protein, binds to PREs but phomutants show only mild phenotypes compared with other PcG mutants. We characterize pho-like, a gene encoding a protein with high similarity to Pho. Pho-like binds to Pho-binding sites in vitro and pho-like,pho double mutants show more severe misexpression of homeotic genes than do the single mutants. These results suggest that Pho and Pho-like act redundantly to repress homeotic genes. We examined the distribution of five PcG proteins on polytene chromosomes from pho-like, pho double mutants. Pc, Psc, Scm, E(z) and Ph remain bound to polytene chromosomes at most sites in the absence of Pho and Pho-like. At a few chromosomal locations,however, some of the PcG proteins are no longer present in the absence of Pho and Pho-like, suggesting that Pho-like and Pho may anchor PcG protein complexes to only a subset of PREs. Alternatively, Pho-like and Pho may not participate in the anchoring of PcG complexes, but may be necessary for transcriptional repression mediated through PREs. In contrast to Pho and Pho-like, removal of Trithorax-like/GAGA factor or Zeste, two other DNA-binding proteins implicated in PRE function, does not cause misexpression of homeotic genes or reporter genes in imaginal disks.},

PREs are required for the recruitment and maintenance of repression by the PcG proteins. PREs are made up of binding sites for multiple DNA-binding proteins, but it is still unclear what combination(s) of binding sites is required for PRE activity. Here we compare the binding sites and activities of two closely linked yet separable PREs of the Drosophila engrailed (en) gene, PRE1 and PRE2. Both PRE1 and PRE2 contain binding sites for multiple PRE\textendash DNA-binding proteins, but the number, arrangement, and spacing of the sites differs between the two PREs. These differences have functional consequences. Both PRE1 and PRE2 mediate pairing-sensitive silencing of mini-white, a functional assay for PcG repression; however, PRE1 requires two binding sites for Pleiohomeotic (Pho), whereas PRE2 requires only one Pho-binding site for this activity. Furthermore, for full pairing-sensitive silencing activity, PRE1 requires an AT-rich region not found in PRE2. These two PREs behave differently in a PRE embryonic and larval reporter construct inserted at an identical location in the genome. Our data illustrate the diversity of architecture and function of PREs.},

Here, we discuss the relative merits of live-cell SMT techniques currently in use. We provide new insights into how Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, master regulators of development and cell differentiation, decipher genetic and epigenetic information to achieve binding stability and highlight that Polycomb condensates facilitate target-search efficiency. We provide perspectives on liquid-liquid phase separation in organizing Polycomb targets. We suggest that epigenetic complexes integrate genetic and epigenetic information for target binding and localization and achieve target-search efficiency through nuclear organization.},

  abstract = {Genes involved in eye development are highly conserved between vertebrates and Drosophila. Given the complex genetic network controlling early eye development, identification of regulatory sequences controlling gene expression will provide valuable insights toward understanding central events of early eye specification. We have focused on defining regulatory elements critical for Drosophila eyes absent (eya) expression. Although eya has a complex expression pattern during development, analysis of eye-specific mutations in the gene revealed a region selectively deleted in the eye-specific alleles. Here we have performed detailed analysis of the region deleted in the eye-specific eya2 allele. This analysis shows that this region can direct earlyeya gene expression in a pattern consistent with that of normal eya in eye progenitor cells. Functional studies indicate that this element will restore appropriate eya transcript expression to rescue the eye-specific allele. We have examined regulation of this element during eye specification, both in normal eye development and in ectopic eye formation. These studies demonstrate that the element was activated upon ectopic expression of the eye specification genes eyeless and dachshund, but does not respond to ectopic expression of eya or sine oculis. The differential regulation of this element by genes involved during early retinal formation reveals new aspects of the genetic hierarchy of eye development.},

The posterior Hox group expanded in the deuterostome clade and patterns caudal and distal structures. We aimed to address how similar Hox TFs diverge to induce different positional identities. We studied Hox TF DNA-binding and regulatory activity during an in vitro motor neuron differentiation system that recapitulates embryonic development. We found diversity in the genomic binding profiles of different Hox TFs, even among the posterior group paralogs that share similar DNA-binding domains. These differences in genomic binding were explained by differing abilities to bind to previously inaccessible sites. For example, the posterior group HOXC9 had a greater ability to bind occluded sites than the posterior HOXC10, producing different binding patterns and driving differential gene expression programs. From these results, we propose that the differential abilities of posterior Hox TFs to bind to previously inaccessible chromatin drive patterning diversification.

Copper and cadmium, when added to the growth medium of Drosophila Schneider's line 2 cells, can produce a 30\textendash 100 fold induction of metallothionein mRNA levels. The level of induction depends on the amount of copper or cadmium added to the medium and these mRNA levels remain high for at least four days. Copper is less toxic than cadmium and does not induce a typical heat-shock response in the cells.

  abstract = {Transcription activation by Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) at each of two classes of simple CAP-dependent promoters is understood in structural and mechanistic detail. At class I CAP-dependent promoters, CAP activates transcription from a DNA site located upstream of the DNA site for RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP); at these promoters, transcription activation involves protein-protein interactions between CAP and the RNAP {$\alpha$} subunit C-terminal domain that facilitate binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the RNAP-promoter closed complex. At class II CAP-dependent promoters, CAP activates transcription from a DNA site that overlaps the DNA site for RNAP; at these promoters, transcription activation involves both: (i) protein-protein interactions between CAP and RNAP {$\alpha$} subunit C-terminal domain that facilitate binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the RNAP-promoter closed complex; and (ii) protein-protein interactions between CAP and RNAP {$\alpha$} subunit N-terminal domain that facilitates isomerization of the RNAP-promoter closed complex to the RNAP-promoter open complex. Straightforward combination of the mechanisms for transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits synergistic transcription activation by multiple molecules of CAP, or by CAP and other activators. Interference with determinants of CAP or RNAP involved in transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits ``anti-activation'' by negative regulators.

  abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a polarity axis that organizes cells in the plane of the tissue. PCP is conserved in metazoans and is essential for proper development and tissue homeostasis.Asymmetric and mutually exclusive subcellular enrichment of key PCP proteins patterns cells in planar-polarized tissues. PCP proteins also coordinate planar polarity between cells and control polarized behaviours by modulating the cytoskeleton.PCP patterns develop gradually from an initially disordered state through dynamic trafficking and various feedback interactions that can influence protein localization and stability.PCP patterns seem to be globally oriented along a pre-defined axis in a given tissue. Notably, multiple mechanistic inputs may have differential influences on PCP patterning depending on developmental timing and tissue context, and may only partially overlap in different contexts.The morphogenetic events governed by PCP signalling are best understood in Drosophila melanogaster, in which the particular orientation of hairs and bristles on the fly body has served to unravel basic principles of PCP-dependent processes. Information obtained from this model has helped to better understand equivalent mechanisms in vertebrates, particularly in the context of the orientation of fluid flow mediated by multiciliated cells and cell rearrangements during convergent extension.Mutations in PCP genes have been implicated in diverse human pathologies, and the body of evidence supporting the involvement of PCP aberrations in human birth defects continues to grow rapidly.},

However, a connection between PcG-mediated gene silencing and histone methylation has not been established. Here we report the purification and characterization of an EED-EZH2 complex, the human counterpart of the               Drosophila               ESC-E(Z) complex. We demonstrate that the complex specifically methylates nucleosomal histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3-K27). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that H3-K27 methylation colocalizes with, and is dependent on, E(Z) binding at an               Ultrabithorax               (               Ubx               ) Polycomb response element (PRE), and that this methylation correlates with               Ubx               repression. Methylation on H3-K27 facilitates binding of Polycomb (PC), a component of the PRC1 complex, to histone H3 amino-terminal tail.

Recently, genome-wide methods identified an intermediate level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), that play key roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these methods cannot directly examine the interplay between transcriptional activation and chromosome architecture while maintaining spatial information. Here we present a multiplexed, sequential imaging approach (Hi-M) that permits simultaneous detection of chromosome organization and transcription in single nuclei. This allowed us to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome unpairing during awakening of the zygotic genome in intact Drosophila embryos. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture with spatial resolution at different stages of development or during the cell cycle will be key to understanding the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome.},

Such process surmounts enormous specificity, efficiency and celerity challenges using a molecular mechanism that remains poorly understood. Combining biophysical experiments, theory and bioinformatics, we dissect the interplay between the DNA-binding domain of Engrailed, a Drosophila TF, and the regulatory regions of its target genes. We find that Engrailed binding affinity is strongly amplified by the DNA regions flanking the recognition site, which contain long tracts of degenerate recognition-site repeats. Such DNA organization operates as an antenna that attracts TF molecules in a promiscuous exchange among myriads of intermediate affinity binding sites. The antenna ensures a local TF supply, enables gene tracking and fine control of the target~site's basal occupancy. This mechanism illuminates puzzling gene expression data and suggests novel engineering strategies to control gene expression.},

The advent of next-generation sequencing and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing has revolutionized the means by which we study enhancer biology. In this review, we cover recent developments in the prediction of enhancers based on chromatin characteristics and their identification by functional reporter assays and endogenous DNA perturbations. We discuss that the two latter approaches provide different and complementary insights, especially in assessing enhancer sufficiency and necessity for transcription activation. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into mechanistic aspects of enhancer function, including findings about cofactor requirements and the role of post-translational histone modifications such as monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1). Finally, we survey how these approaches advance our understanding of transcription regulation with respect to promoter specificity and transcriptional bursting and provide an outlook covering open questions and promising developments.},

Critically, despite this large heterogeneity, we are able to visualize nanometer-sized epigenetic domains at the single-cell level. In addition, absolute contact frequencies within and between TADs are to a large extent defined by genomic distance, higher-order chromosome architecture, and epigenetic identity. We propose that TADs and compartments are organized by multiple, small-frequency, yet specific interactions that are regulated by epigenetics and transcriptional state.},

Here, we examined this during the first hours of Drosophila embryogenesis. DNA-FISH confirms that intra-TAD pairwise proximity is established during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) but with extensive cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most newly formed boundaries are occupied by combinations of CTCF, BEAF-32, and/or CP190. Depleting each insulator individually from chromatin revealed that TADs can still establish, although with lower insulation, with a subset of boundaries (\textasciitilde 10\%) being more dependent on specific insulators. Some weakened boundaries have aberrant gene expression due to unconstrained enhancer activity. However, the majority of misexpressed genes have no obvious direct relationship to changes in domain-boundary insulation. Deletion of an active promoter (thereby blocking transcription) at one boundary had a greater impact than deleting the insulator-bound region itself. This suggests that cross-talk between insulators and active promoters and/or transcription might reinforce domain boundary insulation during embryogenesis.},

While cross-linking, immuno-precipitation and super-resolution microscopy argue against direct interaction of Polycomb with some lncRNAs, there is increasing evidence supporting the ability of both PRC1 and PRC2 to functionally associate with RNA. Recent data indicate that these interactions are in most cases spurious, but nonetheless crucial for a number of cellular activities. In this review, we suggest that while PRC1/2 recruitment by HOTAIR might be direct, in the case of Xist, it might occur indirectly and, at least in part, through the process of liquid\textendash liquid phase separation. We present recent models of lncRNA-mediated PRC1/2 recruitment to their targets and describe potential RNA-mediated roles in the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus.},

Mammalian cells express multiple oxygen-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their oxygen affinities and hence their ability to sense oxygen. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG\textendash independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is oxygen sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, oxygen directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.},

The halteres are sensitive to Coriolis forces that result from angular rotations of the body and mediate corrective reflexes during flight. Like the aerodynamically functional fore wings, the halteres beat during flight and are equipped with their own set of control muscles. It is shown that motoneurons innervating muscles of the haltere receive strong excitatory input from directionally sensitive visual interneurons. Visually guided flight maneuvers of flies may be mediated in part by efferent modulation of hard-wired equilibrium reflexes.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs) with partially overlapping expression is a widespread strategy to generate novel gene-expression patterns and, thus, cellular diversity. Known mechanisms underlying combinatorial activity require co-expression of TFs within the same cell. Here, we describe the mechanism by which two TFs that are never co-expressed generate a new, intersectional expression pattern in C.~elegans embryos: lineage-specific priming of a gene by a transiently expressed TF generates a unique intersection with a second TF acting on the same gene four cell divisions later; the second TF is expressed in multiple cells but only activates transcription in those where priming occurred. Early induction of active transcription is necessary and sufficient to establish a competent state, maintained by broadly expressed regulators in the absence of the initial trigger. We uncover additional cells diversified through this mechanism. Our findings define a mechanism for combinatorial TF activity with important implications for generation of cell-type diversity.},

This review covers the current knowledge of fusion protein linkers and summarizes examples for their design and application. The general properties of linkers derived from naturally-occurring multi-domain proteins can be considered as the foundation in linker design. Empirical linkers designed by researchers are generally classified into 3 categories according to their structures: flexible linkers, rigid linkers, and in vivo cleavable linkers. Besides the basic role in linking the functional domains together (as in flexible and rigid linkers) or releasing the free functional domain in vivo (as in in vivo cleavable linkers), linkers may offer many other advantages for the production of fusion proteins, such as improving biological activity, increasing expression yield, and achieving desirable pharmacokinetic profiles.},

Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer\textendash promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150\,kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.},

How Polycomb domains are reprogrammed during mammalian preimplantation development remains largely unclear. Here we show that, although H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are highly colocalized in gametes, they undergo differential reprogramming dynamics following fertilization. H3K27me3 maintains thousands of maternally biased domains until the blastocyst stage, whereas maternally biased H2AK119ub1 distribution in zygotes is largely equalized at the two-cell stage. Notably, while maternal PRC2 depletion has a limited effect on global H2AK119ub1 in early embryos, it disrupts allelic H2AK119ub1 at H3K27me3 imprinting loci including Xist. By contrast, acute H2AK119ub1 depletion in zygotes does not affect H3K27me3 imprinting maintenance, at least by the four-cell stage. Importantly, loss of H2AK119ub1, but not H3K27me3, causes premature activation of developmental genes during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and subsequent embryonic arrest. Thus, our study reveals distinct dynamics and functions of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in mouse preimplantation embryos.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Recent genome-wide analyses showed a Polycomb (PC) distribution with binding to discrete PcG response elements (PREs). Within the cell nucleus, PcG proteins localize in structures called PC bodies that contain PcG-silenced genes, and it has been recently shown that PREs form local and long-range spatial networks. Here, we studied the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic (PH). Thanks to a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we could analyze the formation and the mobility of PC bodies during fly embryogenesis as well as compare their behavior to that of the condensed fraction of euchromatin. Immuno-FISH experiments show that PC bodies mainly correspond to 3D structural counterparts of the linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates that two types of motion influence the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H2Av-GFP. First, chromatin domains and PC bodies coordinately undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories. Second, each PC body and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion. In this motion regime, PC bodies move within volumes slightly larger than those of condensed chromatin domains. Moreover, both types of domains move within volumes much smaller than chromosome territories, strongly restricting their possibility of interaction with other nuclear structures. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis strongly decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing.},

To disentangle these two phenomena, here we analyze the temporal function of two PRC1 proteins, Polyhomeotic (Ph) and Polycomb (Pc), on Hox gene clusters during Drosophila embryogenesis. We show that the absence of Ph or Pc affects the higher-order chromatin folding of Hox clusters prior to ectopic Hox gene transcription, demonstrating that PRC1 primary function during early embryogenesis is to compact its target chromatin. Moreover, the differential effects of Ph and Pc on Hox cluster folding match the differences in ectopic Hox gene expression observed in these two mutants. Our data suggest that PRC1 maintains gene silencing by folding chromatin domains and impose architectural layer to gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins silence master regulatory genes required to properly confer cell identity during the development of both Drosophila and mammals. They may act through chromatin compaction and higher-order folding of chromatin inside the cell nucleus. During the last decade, analysis on interphase chromosome architecture discovered self-interacting regions named topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs result from the 3D chromatin folding of a succession of transcribed and repressed epigenomic domains and from loop extrusion mediated by cohesin/CTCF in mammals. Polycomb silenced chromatin constitutes one type of repressed epigenomic domains which form compacted nano-compartments inside cell nuclei. Recruitment of canonical PcG proteins on chromatin relies on initial binding to discrete elements and further spreading into large chromatin domains covered with H3K27me3. Some of these discrete elements have a bivalent nature both in mammals and Drosophila and are dynamically regulated during development. Loops can occur between them, suggesting that their interaction plays both functional and structural roles. Formation of large chromatin domains covered by H3K27me3 seems crucial for PcG silencing and PcG proteins might exert their function through compaction of these domains in both mammals and flies, rather than by directly controlling the nucleosomal accessibility of discrete regulatory elements. In addition, PcG chromatin domains interact over long genomic distances, shaping a higher-order chromatin network. Therefore, PcG silencing might rely on multiscale chromatin folding to maintain cell identity during differentiation.},

The forces that underlie assembly of these states are the collection of noncovalent interaction modules present in all epigenetic regulatory proteins. The focus here is on two protein interaction domains, the RING finger and WD40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) and Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM), which function within the multiprotein assembly called Polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1) and are instrumental in creating the precise three-dimensional state of chromatin. Structural studies of the RAWUL have revealed the key role it plays in forming functionally distinct variations of PRC1. SAM, which has a unique ability to form polymers, has emerged as a key player in the clustering of gene elements required to form repressed chromatin architectures.}

Evidence is presented that Polycomb group (PcG) repressors can influence paused Pol II. ChIP-Seq and GRO-Seq assays were used to determine the genome-wide distributions of Pol II, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3 in extra sex combs (esc) mutant embryos. ESC is a key component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates H3K27me3 modification. Enhanced Pol II occupancy is observed for thousands of genes in esc mutant embryos, including genes not directly regulated by PRC2. Thus, it would appear that silent genes lacking promoter-associated paused Pol II in wild-type embryos are converted into ``poised'' genes with paused Pol II in esc mutants. We suggest that this conversion of silent genes into poised genes might render differentiated cell types susceptible to switches in identity in PcG mutants.},

We demonstrate that Nejire (CBP/EP300 ortholog) is essential for the acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 and lysine-27, whereas Gcn5 (GCN5/PCAF ortholog) for lysine-9 of H3 at ZGA, with these marks being enriched at all actively transcribed genes. Nonetheless, these HATs activate distinct sets of genes. Unexpectedly, individual catalytic dead mutants of either Nejire or Gcn5 can activate zygotic transcription (ZGA) and transactivate a reporter gene in vitro. Together, our data identify Nejire and Gcn5 as key regulators of ZGA.},

We propose the `hourglass' model of remodeller function, in which each remodeller subfamily utilizes diverse specialized proteins and protein domains to assist in nucleosome targeting or to differentially detect nucleosome epitopes. These modules converge to regulate a common DNA translocation mechanism, to inform the conserved ATPase `motor' on whether and how to apply DNA translocation, which together achieve the various outcomes of chromatin remodelling: nucleosome assembly, chromatin access and nucleosome editing.},

In addition to the temporal and spatial sequential activation of Hox genes, proper embryonic development requires that Hox genes get differentially silenced in a cell-type specific manner as development proceeds. Factors contributing to Hox silencing include the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), which control gene expression through epigenetic modifications. This review focuses on PRC-dependent regulation of the Hox genes and is aimed at integrating the growing complexity of PRC functional properties in the context of Hox regulation. In particular, mechanisms underlying PRC binding dynamics as well as a series of studies that have revealed the impact of PRC on the 3D organization of the genome is discussed, which has a significant role on Hox regulation during development.}

Mutational analyses show high-affinity binding with low peptide sequence selectivity through combinatorial interaction of the methyl-lysine with an aromatic cage and positively charged flanking residues with the surrounding negatively charged surface of the fourth MBT repeat. dSfmbt directly interacts with the PcG protein Scm, a related MBT-repeat protein with similar methyl-lysine binding activity. dSfmbt and Scm co-occupy Polycomb response elements of target genes in Drosophila and they strongly synergize in the repression of these target genes, suggesting that the combined action of these two MBT proteins is crucial for Polycomb silencing.},

The spatially restricted pattern of Distal-less expression allows direct visualization of the limb primordia during early embryogenesis.

  abstract = {DNA sequence and inherited gene silencing                            Cell fate decisions require a gene's transcriptional status, whether on or off, to be stably and heritably maintained over multiple cell generations. For silenced genes, heterochromatin domains are associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications, and these histone marks are maintained during DNA replication and chromosome duplication (see the Perspective by De and Kassis). Laprell               et al.               show that parental methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) nucleosomes in               Drosophila               are inherited in daughter cells after replication and can repress transcription, but that they are not sufficient to propagate the mark. Trimethylation of newly incorporated nucleosomes requires recruitment of the methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to neighboring cis-regulatory DNA elements. Coleman and Struhl demonstrate that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting epigenetic memory at a               Drosophila               HOX gene through anchoring of PRC2 at the Polycomb response element binding site. Wang and Moazed examine fission yeast and show that both sequence-dependent and chromodomain sequence-independent mechanisms are required for stable epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications and the epigenetic maintenance of silencing. These studies highlight the crucial role of DNA binding for heritable gene silencing during growth and development.

A long-standing question is whether such epigenetic states can be maintained by the inheritance of cis-acting chromatin modifications. To answer this question, it is necessary to identify those modifications that play a causal role in epigenetic memory and investigate how they are maintained and propagated through multiple rounds of replication.                                         RATIONALE                                Many animals are composed of diverse body segments governed by evolutionarily conserved HOX gene complexes. Early in embryogenesis, cells in each segment heritably activate some HOX genes while silencing others. This provides a paradigm of epigenetic memory in which transient cues establish permanent ON and OFF states of gene expression. In the OFF state, HOX gene chromatin is marked with trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) that is catalyzed by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Here, we investigated whether H3K27me3 nucleosomes are the carriers of epigenetic memory of the OFF state. To this end, we generated a transgenic                 lacZ                 reporter of the                 Drosophila                 HOX gene                 Ultrabithorax                 (                 Ubx                 ), which recapitulates                 Ubx                 regulation throughout development. Deposition of H3K27me3 at this reporter depends on the presence of a Polycomb response element (PRE), the cis-acting DNA to which PRC2 is targeted. We monitored both the OFF state and H3K27me3 after inducing excision of the PRE at different time points during development. Using this strategy, in combination with manipulation of PRC2 activity and H3K27 substrate availability, we assessed the capacity of PRC2 that is not recruited to the PRE to propagate H3K27me3 and investigated whether there is a causal relationship between H3K27me3 inheritance and maintenance of the OFF state.                                                        RESULTS               Focusing on the developing wing imaginal disc where the transgene is normally OFF, we find that PRE excision results in a release from silencing that depends on the cell-division\textendash coupled dilution of H3K27me3 and occurs after a stereotyped number of cell divisions. Further, we show that the rate of dilution depends on the residual capacity of PRC2 that is not recruited by the PRE to propagate the mark. Reducing this capacity increases the rate of dilution and leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of times a cell can divide while maintaining the OFF state. These findings establish a causal relationship between inheritance of the H3K27me3 mark and memory of the OFF state.                                         CONCLUSION                                Our results demonstrate (i) that H3K27me3, once established at a repressed                 Drosophila                 HOX gene, remains heritably associated with that gene; (ii) that local inheritance of the mark transmits the memory of the OFF state from one cell generation to the next; and (iii) that long-term memory depends on efficient copying of the mark after each replication cycle, a process that requires recruitment of PRC2 by the PRE. Taken together, these findings establish H3K27me3 as a determinant of epigenetic memory and identify efficient propagation of the mark by PRE-associated PRC2 as a requirement for perpetuating the memory.                                                                  Epigenetic silencing of a HOX gene by inheritance of H3K27 trimethylation.                   Inheritance of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin depends on the transmission of parental H3K27me3 nucleosomes to daughter DNAs and their capacity to template the H3K27 trimethylation of newly incorporated, na\"ive nucleosomes by PRE-associated PRC2. After PRE excision, residual ``free'' PRC2 can copy the mark, albeit inefficiently, resulting in replication-coupled serial dilution of H3K27me3 and release from silencing. The number of divisions required depends on the rate of dilution, establishing a causal relationship between inheritance of the mark and memory of the OFF state.                                                                         ,                             Many eukaryotic cells can respond to transient environmental or developmental stimuli with heritable changes in gene expression that are associated with nucleosome modifications. However, it remains uncertain whether modified nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting such epigenetic memories, as opposed to controlling or merely reflecting transcriptional states inherited by other means. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes, once established at a repressed               Drosophila               HOX gene, remain heritably associated with that gene and can carry the memory of the silenced state through multiple rounds of replication, even when the capacity to copy the H3K27me3 mark to newly incorporated nucleosomes is diminished or abolished. Hence, in this context, the inheritance of H3K27 trimethylation conveys epigenetic memory.},

  abstract = {Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are cis-acting DNA sequences that confer heritable states of Drosophila HOX gene expression by anchoring Polycomb and Trithorax Group (PcG and TrxG) chromatin modifiers. PREs are also associated with hundreds of other Drosophila genes, most of which are regulated dynamically in response to developmental and physiological context, rather than heritably like HOX genes. Here, we assess the role(s) PREs play at these other loci by analyzing how genomic inserts of a transgenic form of the HOX gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) can both control and respond to neighboring genes depending on the presence of a single, excisable PRE. Our results support the view that PREs and their associated PcG and TrxG modifiers act primarily to confer quantitative, rather than qualitative, influences on gene expression with the response of any given gene depending on how it integrates this information with other regulatory elements in the local genomic milieu. They also show that PREs can act on neighboring genes selectively and at remarkably long range, but that any given gene can be susceptible or impervious to PRE/PcG/TrxG input depending on context. Finally, we find that transcription and PRE/PcG-dependent silencing are not mutually exclusive: a Ubx transgene inside the intron of a continuously transcribed "host" gene is nevertheless silenced by its resident PRE. We posit that the widely accepted roles of PcG and TrxG complexes in maintaining heritable states of gene expression apply only to a limited coterie of target genes such as HOX genes that are evolutionarily selected to exclude regulatory elements that can over-ride this control.},

  abstract = {Paternal and maternal epigenomes undergo marked changes after fertilization1. Recent epigenomic studies have revealed the unusual chromatin landscapes that are present in oocytes, sperm and early preimplantation embryos, including atypical patterns of histone modifications2\textendash 4 and differences in chromosome organization and accessibility, both in gametes5\textendash 8 and after fertilization5,8\textendash 10. However, these studies have led to very different conclusions: the global absence of local topological-associated domains (TADs) in gametes and their appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the pre-existence of TADs and loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures might relate to allele-specific gene regulation remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental genome (including the X~chromosome), using an optimized single-cell high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (HiC) protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate chromosome organization with allelic expression states and chromatin marks, and reveal that higher-order chromatin structure after fertilization coincides with an allele-specific enrichment of methylation of histone H3 at lysine~27. These early parental-specific domains correlate with gene repression and participate in parentally biased gene expression\textemdash including in recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find TADs that arise in a non-parental-specific manner during a second wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the relationship between TADs and gene expression by investigating structural changes to the paternal X~chromosome before and during X~chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We find that TADs are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal X~chromosome but linger in regions that escape X~chromosome inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression during early development.},

Insulator elements have been proposed to modulate the communication between regulatory elements and promoters due to their ability to insulate genes from regulatory elements or to take part in long-distance interactions. Using a high-resolution chromatin conformation capture (H3C) method, we show that the Drosophila gypsy insulator behaves as a conformational chromatin border that is able to prohibit contacts between a Polycomb response element (PRE) and a distal promoter. On the other hand, two spaced gypsy elements form a chromatin loop that is able to bring an upstream PRE in contact with a downstream gene to mediate its repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiles of the Polycomb protein and its associated H3K27me3 histone mark reflect this insulator-dependent chromatin conformation, suggesting that Polycomb action at a distance can be organized by local chromatin topology.},

It is the catalytic subunit of the PR-DUB complex, which removes PRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1, essential for maintaining transcriptional repression. However, the precise relationship between BAP1 and Polycombs remains elusive. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that BAP1 restricts H2AK119ub1 deposition to Polycomb target sites. This increases the stability of Polycomb with their targets and prevents diffuse accumulation of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3. Loss of BAP1 results in a broad increase in H2AK119ub1 levels that is primarily dependent on PCGF3/5-PRC1 complexes. This titrates PRC2 away from its targets and stimulates H3K27me3 accumulation across the genome, leading to a general chromatin compaction. This provides evidence for a unifying model that resolves the apparent contradiction between BAP1 catalytic activity and its role in~vivo, uncovering molecular vulnerabilities that could be useful for BAP1-related pathologies.},

  abstract = {Control of transcription speed, which influences many co-transcriptional processes, is poorly understood. We report that PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation rate. The PNUTS W401A mutation, which disrupts PP1 binding, causes genome-wide acceleration of transcription associated with hyper-phosphorylation of the Spt5 elongation factor. Immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, Pol II decelerates from {$>$}2 kb/min to {$<$}1 kb/min, which correlates with Spt5 dephosphorylation. Pol II deceleration and Spt5 dephosphorylation require poly(A) site recognition and the PNUTS-PP1 complex, which is in turn necessary for transcription termination. These results lead to a model for termination, the ``sitting duck torpedo'' mechanism, where poly(A) site-dependent deceleration caused by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 dephosphorylation is required to convert Pol II into a viable target for the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease. Spt5 and its bacterial homolog NusG therefore have related functions controlling kinetic competition between RNA polymerases and the termination factors that pursue them.},

  abstract = {Mono-methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) is catalyzed by Set8/KMT5A and regulates numerous aspects of genome organization and function. Loss-of-function mutations in Drosophila melanogaster Set8 or mammalian KMT5A prevent H4K20me1 and disrupt development. Set8/KMT5A also has non-histone substrates, making it difficult to determine which developmental functions of Set8/KMT5A are attributable to H4K20me1 and which to other substrates or to non-catalytic roles. Here, we show that human KMT5A can functionally substitute for Set8 during Drosophila development and that the catalytic SET domains of the two enzymes are fully interchangeable. We also uncovered a role in eye development for the N-terminal domain of Set8 that cannot be complemented by human KMT5A. Whereas Set820/20 null mutants are inviable, we found that an R634G mutation in Set8 predicted from in vitro experiments to ablate catalytic activity resulted in viable adults. Additionally, Set8(R634G) mutants retain significant, albeit reduced, H4K20me1, indicating that the R634G mutation does not eliminate catalytic activity in vivo and is functionally hypomorphic rather than null. Flies engineered to express only unmodifiable H4 histones (H4K20A) can also complete development, but are phenotypically distinct from H4K20R, Set820/20 null, and Set8R634G mutants. Taken together, our results demonstrate functional conservation of KMT5A and Set8 enzymes, as well as distinct roles for Set8 and H4K20me1 in Drosophila development.},

Conversely they are engineered to be nearly meta-stable and disassembled (and reassembled) in a facile manner to allow rapid access to the underlying DNA during processes such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. Nucleosomes protect the genome from DNA damaging agents and provide a lattice onto which a myriad of epigenetic signals are deposited. Moreover, vast strings of nucleosomes provide a framework for assembly of the chromatin fiber and higher-order chromatin structures. Thus, in order to provide a foundation for understanding these functions, we present a review of the basic elements of nucleosome structure and stability, including the association of linker histones.},

Here, we review the state of the field, first recalling the pioneering work that led to the identification of PRC2 and exploring its evolutionary conservation, before examining recent findings on PRC2 structure and biochemical regulation, its facultative subunits, and its interactions with the related Polycomb repressive complex 1. Lastly, we call attention to current models of the role of PRC2 function within the process of gene expression control. Collectively, studies of PRC2 have revealed a complex whose activity is governed by a fine balance of molecular signals and whose enzymatic product is remarkably adapted to mediating the heritability of gene expression states.}

A shift in the balance between repressor and activator forms of Ci toward the activator form is necessary and sufficient to define ``A-type'' cell sorting behavior. Moreover, we show that Engrailed (En), in the absence of Ci, is sufficient to specify ``P-type'' sorting.

BAP1 is activated by ASXL1 to deubiquitinate mono-ubiquitinated H2A at K119 in Polycomb gene repression, but the mechanism of this reaction remains poorly defined. Here we show that the BAP1 C-terminal extension is important for H2A deubiquitination by auto-recruiting BAP1 to nucleosomes in a process that does not require the nucleosome acidic patch. This initial encounter-like complex is unproductive and needs to be activated by the DEUBAD domains of ASXL1, ASXL2 or ASXL3 to increase BAP1's affinity for ubiquitin on H2A, to drive the deubiquitination reaction. The reaction is specific for Polycomb modifications of H2A as the complex cannot deubiquitinate the DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination at H2A K13/15. Our results contribute to the molecular understanding of this important tumor suppressor.}

Hzf is induced by p53 and binds to its DNA-binding domain, resulting in preferential transactivation of proarrest p53 target genes over its proapoptotic target genes. Thus, p53 activation results in cell-cycle arrest in Hzf wild-type MEFs, while in Hzf\`A/\`A MEFs, apoptosis is induced. Exposure of Hzf null mice to ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced apoptosis in several organs, as compared to in wild-type mice. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 transactivation function and suggest that Hzf functions as a key player in regulating cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress.},

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a multiprotein complex that is responsible for generating H3K27me3. In Drosophila, PRC2 is recruited by Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) and then trimethylates flanking nucleosomes, spreading the H3K27me3 mark over large regions of the genome, the ``Polycomb domains.'' What defines the boundary of a Polycomb domain? There is experimental evidence that insulators, PolII, and active transcription can all form the boundaries of Polycomb domains. Here we divide the boundaries of larval Polycomb domains into six different categories. In one category, genes are transcribed toward the Polycomb domain, where active transcription is thought to stop the spreading of H3K27me3. In agreement with this, we show that introducing a transcriptional terminator into such a transcription unit causes an extension of the Polycomb domain. Additional data suggest that active transcription of a boundary gene may restrict the range of enhancer activity of a Polycomb-regulated gene.},

This led us to investigate the importance of these interactions in developmental stability. Deregulation of Cyclin G highlights an organ intrinsic control of developmental noise, linked to the ETP-interacting domain, and enhanced by mutations in genes encoding members of the Polycomb Repressive complexes PRC1 and PR-DUB. Deep-sequencing of wing imaginal discs deregulating CycG reveals that high developmental noise correlates with up-regulation of genes involved in translation and down-regulation of genes involved in energy production. Most Cyclin G direct transcriptional targets are also direct targets of PRC1 and RNAPolII in the developing wing.

As GSC daughters differentiate into nurse cells and oocytes, nurse cells, like embryonic somatic cells, silence genes in traditional Polycomb domains and in generally inactive chromatin. Developmentally controlled expression of two Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-interacting proteins, Pcl and Scm, initiate silencing during differentiation. In GSCs, abundant Pcl inhibits PRC2-dependent silencing globally, while in nurse cells Pcl declines and newly induced Scm concentrates PRC2 activity on traditional Polycomb domains. Our results suggest that PRC2-dependent silencing is developmentally regulated by accessory proteins that either increase the concentration of PRC2 at target sites or inhibit the rate that PRC2 samples chromatin.},

Here, we provide single cell transcriptomic landscapes of pattern formation, proliferation and growth of wing imaginal discs. We found that patterning information is robustly maintained in the single cell transcriptomic data and can provide reference matrices for computationally mapping single cells into discrete spatial domains. Assignment of wing disc single cells to spatial subregions facilitates examination of patterning refinement processes. We also clustered single cells into different proliferation and growth states and evaluated the correlation between cell proliferation/growth states and spatial patterning. Furthermore, single cell transcriptomic analyses allowed us to quantitatively examine disturbances of differentiation, proliferation and growth in a well-established tumor model.

  abstract = {Polycomb group proteins are required for long-term repression of many genes in Drosophila and all metazoans. In Drosophila, DNA fragments called Polycomb-group response elements (PREs) have been identified that mediate the action of Polycomb-group proteins. Previous studies have shown that a 2 kb fragment located from -2.4 kb to -395 bp upstream of the Drosophila engrailed promoter contains a multipartite PRE that can mediate mini-white silencing and act as a PRE in an Ubx-reporter construct. Here, we study the role of this 2 kb fragment in the regulation of the engrailed gene itself. Our results show that within this 2 kb fragment, there are two subfragments that can act as PREs in embryos. In addition to their role in gene silencing, these two adjacent PRE fragments can facilitate the activation of the engrailed promoter by distant enhancers. The repressive action of the engrailed PRE can also act over a distance. A 181 bp subfragment can act as a PRE and also mediate positive effects in an enhancer-detector construct. Finally, a deletion of 530 bp of the 2 kb PRE fragment within the endogenous engrailed gene causes a loss-of-function phenotype, showing the importance of the positive regulatory effects of this PRE-containing fragment. Our data are consistent with the model that engrailed PREs bring chromatin together, allowing both positive and negative regulatory interactions between distantly located DNA fragments.},

Ubx encodes a HOX family transcription factor that specifies segment identity, including transformation of the second set of wings into rudimentary halteres. Ubx is known to control the expression of many genes that regulate tissue growth and patterning, but how it regulates tissue morphogenesis to reshape the wing into a haltere is still unclear. Here, we show that Ubx acts by repressing the expression of two genes in the haltere, Stubble and Notopleural, both of which encode transmembrane proteases that remodel the apical extracellular matrix to promote wing morphogenesis. In addition, Ubx induces expression of the Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases in the haltere, which prevents the basal extracellular matrix remodelling necessary for wing morphogenesis. Our results provide a long-awaited explanation for how Ubx controls morphogenetic transformation.},

In the present study, the physiological characteristics of six sensilla of these two classes are examined within a 20\textendash 400 Hz frequency range, using a noise analysis that quantifies linear and nonlinear encoding properties. Both classes exhibit a broad response maximum near 150 Hz, corresponding to the typical wingbeat frequency of the blowfly, and display rectification, limiting the spike response to a narrow portion of a stimulus cycle. The similarity in the encoding properties between the two groups is largely a consequence of the high wingbeat frequency of flies, which precludes any individual neurone from acting as a magnitude detector. Instead, during flight the campaniform neurones might act as `one-shot' detectors, firing a single action potential at a precise phase of each wing stroke cycle. An array of such detectors would be capable of monitoring the passage of a deformational wave as it travels along the wing during each wingbeat.},

To achieve this, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) bind target genes and use histone modification-dependent feedback mechanisms to form Polycomb chromatin domains and repress transcription. The inter-relatedness of PRC1 and PRC2 activity at these sites has made it difficult to discover the specific components of Polycomb chromatin domains that drive gene repression and to understand mechanistically how this is achieved. Here, by exploiting rapid degron-based approaches and time-resolved genomics, we kinetically dissect Polycomb-mediated repression and discover that PRC1 functions independently of PRC2 to counteract RNA polymerase II binding and transcription initiation. Using single-cell gene expression analysis, we reveal that PRC1 acts uniformly within the cell population and that repression is achieved by controlling transcriptional burst frequency. These important new discoveries provide a mechanistic and conceptual framework for Polycomb-dependent transcriptional control.},

Here we consider mainstream models that link histone modifications to hierarchical recruitment of PcG complexes and compare them to results of a direct test of interdependence between PcG complexes for recruitment to Drosophila genes. The direct test indicates that PcG complexes do not rely on histone modifications to recognize their target genes but use them to stabilize the interactions within large chromatin domains. It also shows that multiple strategies are used to coordinate the targeting of PcG complexes to different genes, which may make the repression of these genes more or less robust.},

While the Polycomb proteins maintain the repressed state of many key developmental genes, the Trithorax proteins ensure that these genes stay active in cells where they have to be expressed. Ash1 is the Trithorax protein that was proposed to counteract Polycomb repression by methylating lysine 36 of histone H3. However, it was recently shown that genetic replacement of Drosophila histone H3 with the variant that carried Arginine instead of Lysine at position 36 did not impair the ability of Ash1 to counteract Polycomb repression. This argues that Ash1 counteracts Polycomb repression by methylating yet unknown substrate(s) and that it is time to look beyond Ash1 methyltransferase SET domain, at other evolutionary conserved parts of the protein that received little attention. Here we used Drosophila genetics to demonstrate that Ash1 requires each of the BAH, PHD and SET domains to counteract Polycomb repression, while AT hooks are dispensable. Our findings argue that, in vivo, Ash1 acts as a multimer. Thereby it can combine the input of the SET domain and PHD-BAH cassette residing in different peptides. Finally, using new loss of function alleles, we show that zygotic Ash1 is required to prevent erroneous repression of homeotic genes of the bithorax complex in the embryo.},

  abstract = {Abstract Polycomb repression is critical for metazoan development. Equally important but less studied is the Trithorax system, which safeguards Polycomb target genes from the repression in cells where they have to remain active. It was proposed that the Trithorax system acts via methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 36 (H3K36), thereby inhibiting histone methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb complexes. Here we test this hypothesis by asking whether the Trithorax group protein Ash1 requires H3K36 methylation to counteract Polycomb repression. We show that Ash1 is the only Drosophila H3K36-specific methyltransferase necessary to prevent excessive Polycomb repression of homeotic genes. Unexpectedly, our experiments reveal no correlation between the extent of H3K36 methylation and the resistance to Polycomb repression. Furthermore, we find that complete substitution of the zygotic histone H3 with a variant in which lysine 36 is replaced by arginine does not cause excessive repression of homeotic genes. Our results suggest that the model, where the Trithorax group proteins methylate histone H3 to inhibit the histone methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb complexes, needs revision.},

  abstract = {Members of the Polycomb group of repressors and trithorax group of activators maintain heritable states of transcription by modifying nucleosomal histones or remodeling chromatin. Although tremendous progress has been made toward defining the biochemical activities of Polycomb and trithorax group proteins, much remains to be learned about how they interact with each other and the general transcription machinery to maintain on or off states of gene expression. The trithorax group protein Kismet (KIS) is related to the SWI/SNF and CHD families of chromatin remodeling factors. KIS promotes transcription elongation, facilitates the binding of the trithorax group histone methyltransferases ASH1 and TRX to active genes, and counteracts repressive methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) by Polycomb group proteins. Here, we sought to clarify the mechanism of action of KIS and how it interacts with ASH1 to antagonize H3K27 methylation in Drosophila. We present evidence that KIS promotes transcription elongation and counteracts Polycomb group repression via distinct mechanisms. A chemical inhibitor of transcription elongation, DRB, had no effect on ASH1 recruitment or H3K27 methylation. Conversely, loss of ASH1 function had no effect on transcription elongation. Mutations in kis cause a global reduction in the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36) - modifications that antagonize H3K27 methylation in vitro. Furthermore, loss of ASH1 significantly decreases H3K36 dimethylation, providing further evidence that ASH1 is an H3K36 dimethylase in vivo. These and other findings suggest that KIS antagonizes Polycomb group repression by facilitating ASH1-dependent H3K36 dimethylation.},

These looped structures form insulated neighborhoods whose integrity is important for proper expression of local genes.

Drosophila is a well-established model for defining mechanisms that drive ZGA. Zelda (ZLD) is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that promotes ZGA in the Drosophila embryo. However, many genomic loci that contain GA-rich motifs become accessible during ZGA independent of ZLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that other early TFs that function with ZLD have not yet been identified, especially those that are capable of binding to GA-rich motifs such as chromatin-linked adaptor for male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins (CLAMP). Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila embryonic development requires maternal CLAMP to (1) activate zygotic transcription; (2) increase chromatin accessibility at promoters of specific genes that often encode other essential TFs; and (3) enhance chromatin accessibility and facilitate ZLD occupancy at a subset of key embryonic promoters. Thus, CLAMP functions as a pioneer factor that plays a targeted yet essential role in ZGA.},

Heterochromatin is a more compact form of chromatin, and is associated with characteristic post-translational histone modifications and chromatin binding proteins. Phase-separation has recently been suggested as a mechanism for heterochromatin formation, through condensation of heterochromatin associated proteins. However, it is unclear how phase-separated condensates can contribute to stable and robust repression, particularly for heritable epigenetic changes. The Polycomb complex PRC1 is known to be key for heterochromatin formation, but the multitude of Polycomb proteins has hindered our understanding of their collective contribution to chromatin repression. Here, we take a quantitative live cell imaging approach to show that PRC1 proteins form multicomponent condensates through hetero-oligomerization. They preferentially seed at H3K27me3 marks, and subsequently write H2AK119Ub marks. Using optogenetics to nucleate local Polycomb condensates, we show that Polycomb phase separation can induce chromatin compaction, but phase separation is dispensable for maintenance of the compacted state. Our data are consistent with a model in which the time integral of historical Polycomb phase separation is progressively recorded in repressive histone marks, which subsequently drive chromatin compaction. These findings link the equilibrium thermodynamics of phase separation with the fundamentally non-equilibrium concept of epigenetic memory.},

  abstract = {Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins organize chromatin at multiple scales to regulate gene expression. A conserved Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph) is important for chromatin compaction and large-scale chromatin organization. Like many SAMs, Ph SAM forms helical head to tail polymers, and SAM-SAM interactions between chromatin-bound Ph/PRC1 are believed to compact chromatin and mediate long-range interactions.  To understand mechanistically how this occurs, we analyzed the effects of Ph SAM on chromatin in vitro. We find that incubation of chromatin or DNA with a truncated Ph protein containing the SAM results in formation of concentrated, phase-separated condensates. Condensate formation depends on Ph SAM, and is enhanced by but not strictly dependent on, its polymerization activity. Ph SAM-dependent condensates can recruit PRC1 from extracts and enhance PRC1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards histone H2A. Overexpression of Ph with an intact SAM increases ubiquitylated H2A in cells. Thus, phase separation is an activity of the SAM, which, in the context of Ph, can mediate large-scale compaction of chromatin into biochemical compartments that facilitate histone modification.}

Understanding how PRC2 targets regions of the genome to be methylated remains poorly understood. Different cell types can show disparate patterns of H3K27me, and chromatin perturbations, such as loss of marks of constitutive heterochromatin, can cause redistribution of H3K27me, implying that DNA sequence, per se, is not sufficient to define the distribution of this mark.

We find that in pho phol mutant animals cells retain the capacity to proliferate but show a high incidence of apoptotic cell death that results in tissue hypoplasia.

In contrast, the PhoRC subunit Sfmbt and the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor Ino80 are not essential for cell viability. Pho and Phol, therefore, execute their critical role for cell survival through mechanisms that do not involve Sfmbt function or INO80 nucleosome remodeling.},

Currently, scientists employ bioluminescent systems for numerous biomedical applications, ranging from highly sensitive cellular assays to bioluminescence-based molecular imaging. Traditionally, these systems are based on Firefly and Renilla luciferases; however, the applicability of these enzymes is limited by their size, stability, and luminescence efficiency. NanoLuc (NLuc), a novel bioluminescence platform, offers several advantages over established systems, including enhanced stability, smaller size, and {$>$}150-fold increase in luminescence. In addition, the substrate for NLuc displays enhanced stability and lower background activity, opening up new possibilities in the field of bioluminescence imaging. The NLuc system is incredibly versatile and may be utilized for a wide array of applications. The increased sensitivity, high stability, and small size of the NLuc system have the potential to drastically change the field of reporter assays in the future. However, as with all such technology, NLuc has limitations (including a non-ideal emission for in vivo applications and its unique substrate) which may cause it to find restricted use in certain areas of molecular biology. As this unique technology continues to broaden, NLuc may have a significant impact in both preclinical and clinical fields, with potential roles in disease detection, molecular imaging, and therapeutic monitoring. This review will present the NLuc technology to the scientific community in a non-biased manner, allowing the audience to adopt their own views of this novel system.},

These two cis-regulatory functions are thought to operate through distinct dedicated elements. By examining the occupancy of the Drosophila pleiohomeotic repressive complex (PhoRC) during embryogenesis, we revealed extensive co-occupancy at developmental enhancers. Using an established in vivo assay for PRE activity, we demonstrated that a subset of characterized developmental enhancers can function as PREs, silencing transcription in a Polycomb-dependent manner. Conversely, some classic Drosophila PREs can function as developmental enhancers in vivo, activating spatio\textendash temporal expression. This study therefore uncovers elements with dual function: activating transcription in some cells (enhancers) while stably maintaining transcriptional silencing in others (PREs). Given that enhancers initiate spatio\textendash temporal gene expression, reuse of the same elements by the Polycomb group (PcG) system may help fine-tune gene expression and ensure the timely maintenance of cell identities.},

It is composed of a trimeric core of SUZ12, EED and EZH1/2 and is responsible for catalysing both di-methylation and tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3). Both H3K27 methylations contribute to the role of PRC2 in maintaining cellular identity. In all cell types, the H3K27me3 modification is associated with repression of genes encoding regulators of alternative lineages. The less well-characterised H3K27me2 modification is ubiquitous throughout the genome and is thought to act like a protective blanket to maintain the repression of non-H3K27me3 associated genes and cell-type-specific enhancers of alternative lineages. Recent cancer genome sequencing studies highlighted that several genes encoding PRC2 components as well as Histone H3 are mutated in multiple cancer types. Intriguingly, these cancers have changes in the global levels of the H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 modifications as well as genome-wide redistributions. Exciting new studies suggest that these changes confer context dependent blocks in cellular differentiation and increased vulnerability to aberrant cancer signalling pathways.}

  abstract = {Abstract   Polycomb group proteins are chromatin-associated transcriptional repressors with essential roles in organism development and differentiation. They exist as part of two main multisubunit complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC1 complexes are defined by a heterodimeric RING-PCGF core capable of monoubiquitinating H2A. Depending on the cofactors that associate with the RING-PCGF core, PRC1 complexes can be further divided into canonical or noncanonical PRC1 (cPRC1 and ncPRC1). The cPRC1 complex is targeted to chromatin through the ability of its CBX subunit to read PRC2-mediated H3K27me3, and it promotes chromatin condensation via heterooligomerisation of its PHC subunits. The various different ncPRC1 complexes are targeted to chromatin independently of H3K27me3 by specific subunits. Recent studies suggest that the majority of PRC1-dependent H2Aub catalytic activity is mediated by the ncPRC1 complexes and that this may partially contribute to the recruitment or activity PRC2. Here we will discuss the data both supporting and conflicting with this hypothesis and examine the emerging evidence for diverse roles of different ncPRC1 complexes in transcriptional regulation, and whether some can contribute to gene activation. Finally, we will also discuss the essential roles of subunits of the cPRC1 and ncPRC1 complexes in the biology of multicellular organisms.}

At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1\textendash 3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1\textendash 3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms.}

This step can be particularly laborious for events that do not cause a visible phenotype, or those which occur at relatively low frequency. A promising strategy to enrich for desired CRISPR events is to co-select for an independent CRISPR event that produces an easily detectable phenotype. Here, we describe a simple negative co-selection strategy involving CRISPR-editing of a dominant female sterile allele, ovoD1. In this system (``ovoD co-selection''), the only functional germ cells in injected females are those that have been edited at the ovoD1 locus, and thus all offspring of these flies have undergone editing of at least one locus. We demonstrate that ovoD co-selection can be used to enrich for knock-out mutagenesis via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and for knock-in alleles via homology-directed repair (HDR). Altogether, our results demonstrate that ovoD co-selection reduces the amount of screening necessary to isolate desired CRISPR events in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key players of epigenetic processes, such as Hox gene regulation, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, stem-cell pluripotency, cell fate determination, reprogramming, and cancer development. PcG proteins repress numerous genes and exert their action through chromatin binding, deposition of specific histone marks, chromatin compaction, and three-dimensional (3D) organization of their target genes. Recent advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies together with microscopy studies have considerably improved our knowledge of their role in the 3D folding of the genome. In this chapter, we will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which PcG factors exert their action in the kilobase-to-megabase scale of the chromatin fiber, and how this specific nuclear organization can influence gene regulation. We will also discuss the role of noncoding RNAs in shaping PcG-dependent chromosomal organization, and how understanding the mode of Polycomb action in 3D genomics has become increasingly important for research on cancer and other diseases.}

Conversely, H3K9me3 enriched heterochromatin prevents differentiation but constitutes a permanent protection against transposable element. We exploited the fungus Podospora anserina, a valuable alternative to higher eukaryote models to question the biological relevance and interplay of these two distinct heterochromatin conformations. We found that H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 modifications are mutually exclusive within gene-rich regions but not within repeats. Lack of PaKmt6 EZH2-like enzyme resulted in loss of H3K27me3 and in significant H3K9me3 reduction, whereas lack of PaKmt1 SU(VAR)3-9-like enzyme caused loss of H3K9me3 only. We established that P. anserina developmental programs require H3K27me3 mediated silencing unlike most fungi studied to date. Our findings provide new insight into roles of these histone marks and into the relationship between chromatin modifications and development.}

General hypotheses for tissue separation based on differential adhesion or tension have been proposed in the past, but with little experimental support. During the last decade, the field has experienced a strong revival, largely driven by renewed interest in biophysical modeling of development. Here, I will discuss the various models of boundary formation and summarize recent studies that have shifted our understanding of the process from the simple juxtaposition of global tissue properties to the characterization of local cellular reactions. Current evidence favors a model whereby separation is controlled by cell surface cues, which, upon cell-cell contact, generate acute changes in cytoskeletal and adhesive properties to inhibit cell mixing, and whereby the integration of multiple local cues may dictate both the global morphogenetic properties of a tissue and its separation from adjacent cell populations.},

In the case of Notch, the intracellular domain (NICD) transduces the signal directly to the nucleus. How enhancers decipher NICD in the real time of developmental decisions is not known. Using the MS2-MCP system to visualize nascent transcripts in single cells in Drosophila embryos, we reveal how two target enhancers read Notch activity to produce synchronized and sustained profiles of transcription. By manipulating the levels of NICD and altering specific motifs within the enhancers, we uncover two key principles. First, increased NICD levels alter transcription by increasing duration rather than frequency of transcriptional bursts. Second, priming of enhancers by tissue-specific transcription factors is required for NICD to confer synchronized and sustained activity; in their absence, transcription is stochastic and bursty. The dynamic response of an individual enhancer to NICD thus differs depending on the cellular context.},

BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor with de-ubiquitinating enzyme activity and has been implicated in chromatin regulation of gene expression. Here we show that BAP1 inhibits cell death induced by unresolved metabolic stress. This prosurvival role of BAP1 depends on its de-ubiquitinating activity and correlates with its ability to dampen the metabolic stress-induced UPR transcriptional network. BAP1 inhibits glucose deprivation-induced reactive oxygen species and ATP depletion, two cellular events contributing to the ER stress-induced cell death. In line with this,  Bap1  KO mice are more sensitive to tunicamycin-induced renal damage. Mechanically, we show that BAP1 represses metabolic stress-induced UPR and cell death through activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and reveal that BAP1 binds to  ATF3  and  CHOP  promoters and inhibits their transcription. Taken together, our results establish a previously unappreciated role of BAP1 in modulating the cellular adaptability to metabolic stress and uncover a pivotal function of BAP1 in the regulation of the ER stress gene-regulatory network. Our study may also provide new conceptual framework for further understanding BAP1 function in cancer.}

Here we provide evidence for a class of histone post-translational modification, serotonylation of glutamine, which occurs at position 5 (Q5ser) on histone H3 in organisms that produce serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)). We demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase 2 can serotonylate histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3)-marked nucleosomes, resulting in the presence of combinatorial H3K4me3Q5ser in vivo. H3K4me3Q5ser displays a ubiquitous pattern of tissue expression in mammals, with enrichment observed in brain and gut, two organ systems responsible for the bulk of 5-HT production. Genome-wide analyses of human serotonergic neurons, developing mouse brain and cultured serotonergic cells indicate that H3K4me3Q5ser nucleosomes are enriched in euchromatin, are sensitive to cellular differentiation and correlate with permissive gene expression, phenomena that are linked to the potentiation of TFIID4\textendash 6 interactions with H3K4me3. Cells that~ectopically express a H3 mutant that cannot be serotonylated display significantly altered expression of H3K4me3Q5ser-target loci, which leads to deficits in differentiation.

  abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous scaffold that is assembled between paired homologous chromosomes during the onset of meiosis. Timely expression of SC coding genes is essential for SC assembly and successful meiosis. However, SC components have an intrinsic tendency to self-organize into abnormal repetitive structures, which are not assembled between the paired homologs and whose formation is potentially deleterious for meiosis and gametogenesis. This creates an interesting conundrum, where SC genes need to be robustly expressed during meiosis, but their expression must be carefully regulated to prevent the formation of anomalous SC structures. In this manuscript, we show that the Polycomb group protein Sfmbt, the Drosophila ortholog of human MBTD1 and L3MBTL2, is required to avoid excessive expression of SC genes during prophase I. Although SC assembly is normal after Sfmbt depletion, SC disassembly is abnormal with the formation of multiple synaptonemal complexes (polycomplexes) within the oocyte. Overexpression of the SC gene corona and depletion of other Polycomb group proteins are similarly associated with polycomplex formation during SC disassembly. These polycomplexes are highly dynamic and have a well-defined periodic structure. Further confirming the importance of Sfmbt, germ line depletion of this protein is associated with significant metaphase I defects and a reduction in female fertility. Since transcription of SC genes mostly occurs during early prophase I, our results suggest a role of Sfmbt and other Polycomb group proteins in downregulating the expression of these and other early prophase I genes during later stages of meiosis.},

Here, we identify a novel activity of PC: inhibition of the histone acetylation activity of CREB-binding protein (CBP). We show that PC and its mammalian CBX orthologs interact directly with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of CBP, binding to the previously identified autoregulatory loop, whose autoacetylation greatly enhances HAT activity. We identify a conserved PC motif adjacent to the chromodomain required for CBP binding and show that PC binding inhibits acetylation of histone H3. CBP autoacetylation impairs PC binding in vitro, and PC is preferentially associated with unacetylated CBP in vivo. PC knockdown elevates the acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac) level globally and at promoter regions of some genes that are bound by both PC and CBP. Conversely, PC overexpression decreases the H3K27ac level in vivo and also suppresses CBP-dependent Polycomb phenotypes caused by overexpression of Trithorax, an antagonist of Polycomb silencing. We find that PC is physically associated with the initiating form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and that many promoters co-occupied by PC and CBP are associated with paused Pol II, suggesting that PC may play a role in Pol II pausing. These results suggest that PC/PRC1 inhibition of CBP HAT activity plays a role in regulating transcription of both repressed and active PC-regulated genes.}

  abstract = {The halteres of dipteran insects are essential sensory organs for flight control. They are believed to detect Coriolis and other inertial forces associated with body rotation during flight. Flies use this information for rapid flight control. We show that the primary afferent neurons of the haltere's mechanoreceptors respond selectively with high temporal precision to multiple stimulus features. Although we are able to identify many stimulus features contributing to the response using principal component analysis, predictive models using only two features, common across the cell population, capture most of the cells' encoding activity. However, different sensitivity to these two features permits each cell to respond to sinusoidal stimuli with a different preferred phase. This feature similarity, combined with diverse phase encoding, allows the haltere to transmit information at a high rate about numerous inertial forces, including Coriolis forces.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) protein complexes repress transcription by modifying target gene chromatin. In               Drosophila               , this repression requires association of PcG protein complexes with               cis               -regulatory Polycomb response elements (PREs), but the interactions permitting formation of these assemblies are poorly understood. We show that the Sfmbt subunit of the DNA-binding Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) and the Scm subunit of the canonical Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) directly bind each other through their SAM domains. The 1.9 \AA{} crystal structure of the Scm-SAM:Sfmbt-SAM complex reveals the recognition mechanism and shows that Sfmbt-SAM lacks the polymerization capacity of the SAM domains of Scm and its PRC1 partner subunit, Ph. Functional analyses in               Drosophila               demonstrate that Sfmbt-SAM and Scm-SAM are essential for repression and that PhoRC DNA binding is critical to initiate PRC1 association with PREs. Together, this suggests that PRE-tethered Sfmbt-SAM nucleates PRC1 recruitment and that Scm-SAM/Ph-SAM-mediated polymerization then results in the formation of PRC1-compacted chromatin.},

Epigenetic and pairing-sensitive silencing are related properties of Polycomb-group proteins, whereas their activities are generally opposed by the trithorax group. Both groups modify chromatin structure, but how their opposing activities are targeted to allow differential maintenance remains a mystery. Here, we identify a strong pairing-sensitive silencing (PSS) element at the 3{${'}$} border of the Drosophila even skipped (eve) locus. This element can maintain repression during embryonic as well as adult eye development. Transgenic dissection revealed that silencing activity depends on a binding site for the Polycomb-group protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) and on phogene function. Binding sites for the trithorax-group protein GAGA factor also contribute, whereas sites for the known Polycomb response element binding factors Zeste and Dsp1 are dispensible. Normally, eve expression in the nervous system is maintained throughout larval stages. An enhancer that functions fully in embryos does not maintain expression, but the adjacent PSS element confers maintenance. This positive activity also depends on pho gene activity and on Pho binding. Thus, a DNA-binding complex requiring Pho is differentially regulated to facilitate epigenetic transcriptional memory of both the active and the repressed state.},

Insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression, suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development.

How remote enhancers relay regulatory information to their target promoters is one of the central mysteries of genome organization and function. A variety of contrasting mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including enhancer tracking, linking, looping, and mobilization to transcription factories. We argue that extreme versions of these mechanisms cannot account for the transcriptional dynamics and precision seen in living cells, tissues, and embryos.

However, the components and mechanisms that define how Polycomb protein complexes achieve this remain enigmatic. Here, we use combinatorial genetic perturbation coupled with quantitative genomics to discover the central determinants of Polycomb-mediated gene repression in mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which mediates higher-order chromatin structures, contributes little to gene repression. Instead, we uncover an unexpectedly high degree of synergy between variant PRC1 complexes, which is fundamental to gene repression. We further demonstrate that variant PRC1 complexes are responsible for distinct pools of H2A monoubiquitylation that are associated with repression of Polycomb target genes and silencing during X chromosome inactivation. Together, these discoveries reveal a new variant PRC1-dependent logic for Polycomb-mediated gene repression.},

  abstract = {Histone-modifying systems play fundamental roles in gene regulation and the development of multicellular organisms. Histone modifications that are enriched at gene regulatory elements have been heavily studied, but the function of modifications found more broadly throughout the genome remains poorly understood. This is exemplified by histone H2A monoubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1), which is enriched at Polycomb-repressed gene promoters but also covers the genome at lower levels. Here, using inducible genetic perturbations and quantitative genomics, we found that the BAP1 deubiquitylase plays an essential role in constraining H2AK119ub1 throughout the genome. Removal of BAP1 leads to pervasive genome-wide accumulation of H2AK119ub1, which causes widespread reductions in gene expression. We show that elevated H2AK119ub1 preferentially counteracts Ser5 phosphorylation on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at gene regulatory elements and causes reductions in transcription and transcription-associated histone modifications. Furthermore, failure to constrain pervasive H2AK119ub1 compromises Polycomb complex occupancy at a subset of Polycomb target genes, which leads to their derepression, providing a potential molecular rationale for why the BAP1 ortholog in Drosophila has been characterized as a Polycomb group gene. Together, these observations reveal that the transcriptional potential of the genome can be modulated by regulating the levels of a pervasive histone modification.},

This isoform also promotes the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and contributes to efficient reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. These results reveal a pivotal role for an AS event in the regulation of pluripotency through the control of critical ESC-specific transcriptional programs.},

How the recruitment of poised RNA Pol II is regulated during development is not known. By isolating muscle tissue from Drosophila embryos at five stages of differentiation, we show that the recruitment of poised Pol II occurs at many genes de novo and this makes them permissive for future gene expression. A comparison with other tissues shows that these changes are stage specific and not tissue specific. In contrast, Polycomb group repression is tissue specific, and in combination with Pol II (the balanced state) marks genes with highly dynamic expression. This suggests that poised Pol II is temporally regulated and is held in check in a tissue-specific fashion. We compare our data with findings in mammalian embryonic stem cells and discuss a framework for predicting developmental programs on the basis of the chromatin state.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase\textendash seq) from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase\textendash seq fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned\textemdash in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.},

Pioneer transcription factors are essential for remodeling the chromatin and driving the initial wave of zygotic gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, the pioneer factor Zelda is essential for development through this dramatic period of reprogramming, known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). However, it was unknown whether additional pioneer factors were required for this transition. We identified an additional maternally encoded factor required for development through the MZT, GAGA Factor (GAF). GAF is necessary to activate widespread zygotic transcription and to remodel the chromatin accessibility landscape. We demonstrated that Zelda preferentially controls expression of the earliest transcribed genes, while genes expressed during widespread activation are predominantly dependent on GAF. Thus, progression through the MZT requires coordination of multiple pioneer-like factors, and we propose that as development proceeds control is gradually transferred from Zelda to GAF.},

Modern experimental techniques provide massive data on the global behavior of biological systems, and systematically using these large datasets for refining existing knowledge is a major challenge. Here we introduce an extended computational framework that combines formalization of existing qualitative models, probabilistic modeling, and integration of high-throughput experimental data. Using our methods, it is possible to interpret genomewide measurements in the context of prior knowledge on the system, to assign statistical meaning to the accuracy of such knowledge, and to learn refined models with improved fit to the experiments. Our model is represented as a probabilistic factor graph, and the framework accommodates partial measurements of diverse biological elements. We study the performance of several probabilistic inference algorithms and show that hidden model variables can be reliably inferred even in the presence of feedback loops and complex logic. We show how to refine prior knowledge on combinatorial regulatory relations using hypothesis testing and derive p-values for learned model features. We test our methodology and algorithms on a simulated model and on two real yeast models. In particular, we use our method to explore uncharacterized relations among regulators in the yeast response to hyper-osmotic shock and in the yeast lysine biosynthesis system. Our integrative approach to the analysis of biological regulation is demonstrated to synergistically combine qualitative and quantitative evidence into concrete biological predictions.},

The irradiated disks were cultured in adult female hosts, where the marked cell gives rise to a clone. After retransplantation into a larval host the differentiation of such clones was analyzed. It is shown that changes in determination (transdetermination) can occur in such cell clones. Thus, presumptive palp cells which normally produce their own type of cells by cell heredity, may give rise to wing cells (allotypic elements). Presumptive cells of the arista and the third antennal segment may produce tarsal cells, whereas the anlage of the second segment rarely forms any allotypic elements.

  abstract = {The development of Drosophila imaginal discs serves as a model system to understand how genes determine the shape and size of an organ. The identification of genes involved in this process is an important step towards this goal. Here we describe a P-element based enhancer trap screen for genes expressed in the larval imaginal discs. Our aim was to establish a large collection of enhancer trap lines each showing expression of Gal4 in imaginal discs. To this end, we improved the well established P-element vector pGawB in order to obtain higher in vivo transposition frequencies. In addition we chose an F1-screening approach using UAS-GFP as a reporter gene. This system permits the efficient screening of larval and pupal stages of living animals and the detection of imaginal gene expression patterns through the transparent cuticle. The procedure has been optimized for high-throughput. 2'000 P-element insertions have been established which exhibit expression in imaginal discs.},

  abstract = {In many species, centromere identity is specified epigenetically by special nucleosomes containing a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, designated as CENP-A in humans and CID in Drosophila melanogaster. After partitioning of centromere-specific nucleosomes onto newly replicated sister centromeres, loading of additional CENP-A/CID into centromeric chromatin is required for centromere maintenance in proliferating cells. Analyses with cultured cells have indicated that transcription of centromeric DNA by RNA polymerase II is required for deposition of new CID into centromere chromatin. However, a dependence of centromeric CID loading on transcription is difficult to reconcile with the notion that the initial embryonic stages appear to proceed in the absence of transcription in Drosophila, as also in many other animal species. To address the role of RNA polymerase II\textendash mediated transcription for CID loading in early Drosophila embryos, we have quantified the effects of alpha-amanitin and triptolide on centromeric CID-EGFP levels. Our analyses demonstrate that microinjection of these two potent inhibitors of RNA polymerase II\textendash mediated transcription has at most a marginal effect on centromeric CID deposition during progression through the early embryonic cleavage cycles. Thus, we conclude that at least during early Drosophila embryogenesis, incorporation of CID into centromeres does not depend on RNA polymerase II\textendash mediated transcription.},

We show that crm is dynamically regulated during replication and identify the Histone gene cluster (His-C) as a major CRM target. Surprisingly, CRM is specifically required for the expression of the Histone H1 gene, like the promoter-bound transcription factor TRF2. Consistently with this, CRM genetically interacts and co-immunoprecipitates with TRF2. However, the Polycomb phenotypes observed in crm mutants are not observed in TRF2 hypomorphic mutants, suggesting that they correspond to independent roles of CRM. CRM is thus a highly pleiotropic factor involved in both activation and repression.},

Integration of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and RNA sequencing reveals unique events associated with specification toward each lineage. Lineagespecific dynamic alterations in DNA methylation and H3K4me1 are evident at putative distal regulatory elements that are frequently bound by pluripotency factors in the undifferentiated hESCs. In addition, we identified germ-layer-specific H3K27me3 enrichment at sites exhibiting high DNA methylation in the undifferentiated state. A better understanding of these initial specification events will facilitate identification of deficiencies in current approaches, leading to more faithful differentiation strategies as well as providing insights into the rewiring of human regulatory programs during cellular transitions.},

Hypomorphic and amorphic pho alleles are recessive lethals with the lethal individuals showing partial homeotic transformations of antennae, legs, abdominal segments, and internal structures. In addition, pho mutations produce pattern abnormalities in the legs and a novel sixth tarsal segment phenotype. The pho adult phenotypic effects are restricted to discrete spatial regions of the imaginal discs. In leg discs these effects are localized in the upper medial quarter of the discs and show a striking correlation with the organization of positional information as proposed by the polar coordinate model.},

Candidate genes include PcG components and chromatin factors, as well as many protein-modifying enzymes, including components of the SUMOylation pathway. In the absence of SUMO, Pc foci coagulate into larger aggregates. Conversely, loss of function of the SUMO peptidase Velo disperses Pc foci. Moreover, SUMO and Velo colocalize with PcG proteins at PREs, and Pc SUMOylation affects its chromatin targeting, suggesting that the dynamic regulation of Pc SUMOylation regulates PcG-mediated silencing by modulating the kinetics of Pc binding to chromatin as well as its ability to form Polycomb foci.},

Here, we describe multi-CUT\&Tag, an adaptation of CUT\&Tag that overcomes these hurdles by using antibody-specific barcodes to simultaneously map multiple proteins in the same cells. Highly specific multi-CUT\&Tag maps of histone marks and RNA Polymerase II uncovered sites of co-localization in the same cells, active and repressed genes, and candidate cis-regulatory elements. Single-cell multi-CUT\&Tag profiling facilitated identification of distinct cell types from a mixed population and characterization of cell-type-specific chromatin architecture. In sum, multi-CUT\&Tag increases the information content per cell of epigenomic maps, facilitating direct analysis of the interplay of different chromatin proteins.},

Application of the ovoD co-selection method offers expedited generation and enrichment of scarlessly edited alleles without the need for linked transformation markers, which specifically in the case of exon editing can impact allele usability. However, we found that knockin procedures by homology-directed repair (HDR) under ovoD co-selection resulted in low transformation efficiency. This is likely due to repeated rounds of Cas9 cleavage of HDR donor and/or engineered genomic locus DNA, as noted for other CRISPR/Cas9 editing strategies before, impeding the recovery of correctly edited alleles. Here we provide a one-step protocol to improve the generation of scarless alleles by ovoD-co-selection with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) binding site masking. Using this workflow, we constructed human disease alleles for two Drosophila genes, unc-13/CG2999 and armadillo/CG11579. We show and quantify how a known countermeasure, the insertion of silent point mutations into protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) or sgRNA homology regions, can potently suppress unintended sequence modifications during CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of D. melanogaster under ovoD co-selection. This strongly increased the recovery frequency of disease alleles.},

However, most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to stochastically generate frameshifting indels and adoption has been limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the precise incorporation of large DNA sequences, including screenable markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele. To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies that express Cas9 in the germline and directly compared HDR and off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair toward HDR. Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies yields the highest efficiency HDR and that target sites can be selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR technology for Drosophila research.},

Here we review some of these advances in early Drosophila development, which bring the embryo on par with its single celled counterparts. In particular, we discuss progress in methods to measure mRNA and protein distributions in fixed and living embryos, and we highlight some initial applications that lead to fundamental new insights about molecular transcription processes.

The homeotic mutant, ss(a40a), was found to have a temperature-sensitive transformation of the arista segment of the antennal complex to a tarsus of the leg. In a selected stock penetrance was complete, so that at 29 degrees C normal aristae were produced, whereas at 17 degrees C complete tarsi developed in all flies. "Temperature-shift" studies revealed a temperature-sensitive period in the third larval instar. The temperature-initiated action of ss(a40a) does not appear to result from a simple wave or gradient of determination passing through the disc. Shifts up during the temperature-sensitive period yielded leg tissue proximally, which increased distally with progressively later shifts. Shifts down yielded leg tissue at the aristal base, which retreated with later shifts.},

Fab-7 is a PRE-containing regulatory element from the homeotic gene Abdominal-B. When present in multiple copies in the genome, Fab-7 can induce long-distance gene contacts that enhance PcG-dependent silencing. We show here that components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery are involved in PcG-mediated silencing at Fab-7 and in the production of small RNAs at transgenic Fab-7 copies. In general, these mutations do not affect the recruitment of PcG components, but they are specifically required for the maintenance of long-range contacts between Fab-7 copies. Dicer-2, PIWI, and Argonaute1, three RNAi components, frequently colocalize with PcG bodies, and their mutation significantly reduces the frequency of PcG-dependent chromosomal associations of endogenous homeotic genes. This suggests a novel role for the RNAi machinery in regulating the nuclear organization of PcG chromatin targets.},

The two malignant brain tumour (MBT) repeats of Scm form a domain that preferentially binds to monomethylated lysine residues either as a free amino acid or in the context of peptides, while unmodified or di- or trimethylated lysine residues are bound with significantly lower affinity. The crystal structure of a monomethyl-lysine-containing histone tail peptide bound to the MBT repeat domain shows that the methyl-lysine side chain occupies a binding pocket in the second MBT repeat formed by three conserved aromatic residues and one aspartate. Insertion of the monomethylated side chain into this pocket seems to be the main contributor to the binding affinity. Functional analyses in Drosophila show that the MBT domain of Scm and its methyl-lysine-binding activity are required for repression of Hox genes.},

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) cooperate with TFs and epigenetic alterations to constitute a hierarchical complexity in transcriptional gene regulation. While clearly implicated in biological processes, our understanding of these complex regulatory mechanisms is still limited and incomplete. Various online software have been proposed for uncovering transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks, however, there is a lack of effective web-based software capable of constructing underlying interactive organizations between post-translational and transcriptional regulatory components. Here, we present an open web server, post-translational hierarchical gene regulatory network (PTHGRN) to unravel relationships among PTMs, TFs, epigenetic modifications and gene expression. PTHGRN utilizes a graphical Gaussian model with partial least squares regression-based methodology, and is able to integrate protein\textendash protein interactions, ChIP-seq and gene expression data and to capture essential regulation features behind high-throughput data. The server provides an integrative platform for users to analyze ready-to-use public high-throughput Omics resources or upload their own data for systems biology study. Users can choose various parameters in the method, build network topologies of interests and dissect their associations with biological functions. Application of the software to stem cell and breast cancer demonstrates that it is an effective tool for understanding regulatory mechanisms in biological complex systems.

Both the enzymatic activity of PRC2 and its chromatin recruitment, spreading, and eviction are exquisitely regulated via interactions with cofactors and DNA elements (such as unmethylated CpG islands), histones, RNA (nascent mRNA and long noncoding RNA), and R-loops. PRC2-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is recognized by distinct classes of effectors such as canonical PRC1 and BAH module-containing proteins (notably BAHCC1 in human). These effectors mediate gene silencing by different mechanisms including phase separation-related chromatin compaction and histone deacetylation. We discuss recent advances in understanding the structural architecture of PRC2, the regulation of its activity and chromatin recruitment, and the molecular mechanisms underlying Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. Because PRC deregulation is intimately associated with the development of diseases, a better appreciation of Polycomb-based (epi)genomic regulation will have far-reaching implications in biology and medicine.},

The induced cells typically form a solid coherent mass with a distinct border between them and the remaining uninduced cells (Fig. 1a). This clean separation between induced and uninduced cells is much sharper than can readily be explained as a result of the induction process. We describe here the culture of amphibian cell and tissue recombinations in solid gels containing cytochalasin in which cell division and cell movement is inhibited during response to induction. This has revealed an effect in which the ability of a cell to respond to induction by differentiating as muscle is enhanced by, or even dependent on, other neighbouring cells differentiating in the same way at the same time. This seems to be a newly described process in animal development, termed the community effect. It helps to explain the formation of blocks of tissue from sheets of cells, and could be of widespread occurrence and significance in morphogenesis resulting from embryonic induction.},

Conversely, Psq lacking the BTB domain (PsqS) is consistently found at Pc loop anchors and at active enhancers, including those that respond to the hormone ecdysone. After stimulation by this hormone, chromatin 3D organization is altered to connect promoters and ecdysone-responsive enhancers bound by PsqS. Our findings link Psq variants lacking the BTB domain to Pc-bound active enhancers, thus shedding light into their molecular function in chromatin changes underlying the response to hormone stimulus.},

Drosophila PcG proteins Sex combs extra (Sce; dRing) and Posterior sex combs (Psc) are core subunits of PRC1-type complexes. The Sce:Psc module acts as an E3 ligase for monoubiquitylation of histone H2A, an activity thought to be crucial for repression by PRC1-type complexes. Here, we created an Sce knockout allele and show that depletion of Sce results in loss of H2A monoubiquitylation in developing Drosophila. Genome-wide profiling identified a set of target genes co-bound by Sce and all other PRC1 subunits. Analyses in mutants lacking individual PRC1 subunits reveals that these target genes comprise two distinct classes. Class I genes are misexpressed in mutants lacking any of the PRC1 subunits. Class II genes are only misexpressed in animals lacking the Psc-Su(z)2 and Polyhomeotic (Ph) subunits but remain stably repressed in the absence of the Sce and Polycomb (Pc) subunits. Repression of class II target genes therefore does not require Sce and H2A monoubiquitylation but might rely on the ability of Psc-Su(z)2 and Ph to inhibit nucleosome remodeling or to compact chromatin. Similarly, Sce does not provide tumor suppressor activity in larval tissues under conditions in which Psc-Su(z)2, Ph and Pc show such activity. Sce and H2A monoubiquitylation are therefore only crucial for repression of a subset of genes and processes regulated by PRC1-type complexes. Sce synergizes with the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex to repress transcription at class I genes, suggesting that H2A monoubiquitylation must be appropriately balanced for their transcriptional repression.},

The Scalloped selector protein controls wing development in Drosophila by regulating the expression of numerous target genes and forming a complex with the Vestigial protein. We show that binding of Vestigial to Scalloped switches the DNA-binding selectivity of Scalloped. Two conserved domains of the Vestigial protein that are not required for Scalloped binding in solution are required for the formation of the heterotetrameric Vestigial-Scalloped complex on DNA. We suggest that Vestigial affects the conformation of Scalloped to create a wing cell-specific DNA-binding selectivity.

In vitro experiments have shown that PcG protein complexes can compact chromatin limiting the activity of chromatin remodelling enzymes and access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. In fitting with these ideas, gene promoters associated with PcG proteins have been reported to be less accessible than other gene promotors. However, it remains largely untested in vivo whether PcG proteins define chromatin accessibility or other chromatin features. To address this important question, we measured chromatin accessibility and examined the nucleosome landscape at PcG protein-bound promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. Combined with genetic ablation strategies, we unexpectedly discover that although PcG protein-occupied gene promoters exhibit reduced accessibility, this does not rely on PcG proteins. Instead, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) appears to play a unique role in driving elevated nucleosome occupancy and decreased nucleosomal spacing in Polycomb chromatin domains. Our new genome-scale observations argue, in contrast to the prevailing view, that PcG proteins and Polycomb chromatin domains do not significantly affect chromatin accessibility and highlight an underappreciated complexity in the relationship between chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome landscape and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression.}

Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment.

  abstract = {The earliest stages of development in most metazoans are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization, at a period known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation. To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8), during (mitotic cycle 13), and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10, we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected, early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong early association of ZLD with regions not active until the MZT suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.},

Cell type-specific enhancer selection involves the binding of lineage-determining transcription factors that prime enhancers. Signal-dependent transcription factors bind to primed enhancers, which enables these broadly expressed factors to regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers. The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization.},

We believe that the central issue is causality: are histone modifications responsible for differences between chromatin states, or are differences in modifications mostly consequences of dynamic processes, such as transcription and nucleosome remodeling? We find that inferences of causality are often based on correlation and that patterns of some key histone modifications are more easily explained as consequences of nucleosome disruption in the presence of histone modifying enzymes. We suggest that the 35-year-old DNA accessibility paradigm provides a mechanistically sound basis for understanding the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance. Based on this view, histone modifications and variants contribute to diversification of a chromatin landscape shaped by dynamic processes that are driven primarily by transcription and nucleosome remodeling.},

Classical recruitment models consider the pre-existence of repressive histone marks; still, de novo target binding overcomes the absence of both H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub. The CpG islands (CGIs), non-core proteins, and RNA molecules are involved in Polycomb recruitment. Nonetheless, it is unclear how de novo targets are identified depending on the physiological context and developmental stage and which are the leading players stabilizing Polycomb complexes at domain nucleation sites. Here, we examine the features of de novo sites and the accessory elements bridging its recruitment and discuss the first steps of Polycomb domain formation and transcriptional regulation, comprehended by the experimental reconstruction of the repressive domains through time-resolved genomic analyses in mammals.},

Although in yeast all H3K4 methylation patterns, including H3K4me1, are implemented by Set1/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1), there are three classes of COMPASS-like complexes in Drosophila that could carry out H3K4me1 on enhancers: dSet1, Trithorax, and Trithorax-related (Trr). Here, we report that Trr, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Mll3/4 COMPASS-like complexes, can function as a major H3K4 monomethyltransferase on enhancers in vivo. Loss of Trr results in a global decrease of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels in various tissues. Assays with the cut wing margin enhancer implied a functional role for Trr in enhancer-mediated processes. A genome-wide analysis demonstrated that Trr is required to maintain the H3K4me1 and H3K27ac chromatin signature that resembles the histone modification patterns described for enhancers. Furthermore, studies in the mammalian system suggested a role for the Trr homolog Mll3 in similar processes. Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers.},

Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with 'Placeholder' nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 - establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.},

Among the least well-understood histone modifications in vivo are those that occur on the surface of the globular domain of histones, despite their causing the most profound structural alterations of the nucleosome in vitro. We utilized a Drosophila system to replace the canonical histone genes with mutated histone transgenes. Mutations predicted to mimic or prevent acetylation on histone H3 lysine (K) 56, K115, K122, and both K115/K122, or to prevent or mimic phosphorylation on H3 threonine (T) 118 and T80, all caused lethality, with the exception of K122R mutants. T118 mutations caused profound growth defects within wing discs, while K115R, K115Q, K56Q, and the K115/K122 mutations caused more subtle growth defects. The H3 K56R and H3 K122R mutations caused no defects in growth, differentiation, or transcription within imaginal discs, indicating that H3 K56 acetylation and K122 acetylation are dispensable for these functions. In agreement, we found the antibody to H3 K122Ac, which was previously used to imply a role for H3 K122Ac in transcription in metazoans, to be non-specific in vivo. Our data suggest that chromatin structural perturbations caused by acetylation of K56, K115, or K122 and phosphorylation of T80 or T118 are important for key developmental processes.}

  abstract = {Histone H3 proteins play fundamental roles in DNA packaging, gene transcription, and the transmission of epigenetic states. In addition to posttranslational modifications of their N termini, the use of H3 variants contributes to their regulatory repertoire. Canonical histone H3.2 is expressed during S phase and differs by four amino acid residues from the variant histone H3.3, which is synthesized in a cell-cycle-independent manner [1]. Because H3.3 is enriched within actively transcribed loci [1, 2, 3], and because di- and trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 are hallmarks of chromatin at such sites in the genome [4], the H3.3K4 residue is considered to serve as the major regulatory determinant for the transcriptional state of a gene. Here we use genetic approaches in Drosophila to replace all 46 gene copies of His3.2 with mutant derivatives and thereby demonstrate that canonical and variant H3 can functionally replace each other. Cells are able to divide and differentiate when H3.2 is entirely absent but replaced by S phase-expressed H3.3. Moreover, although slowed down in their proliferative capacity, cells that code for a nonmethylatable residue instead of K4 in all canonical and variant H3 genes are competent to respond to major developmental signaling pathways by activating target gene expression. Hence, the presence of different H3 protein species is not essential in Drosophila and transcriptional regulation can occur in the complete absence of H3K4 methylation.},

We demonstrate that UBR7 binds to post-nucleosomal H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 histones via its UBR box and PHD. UBR7 binds to the non-nucleosomal histone chaperone NASP. In the absence of UBR7, the pool of NASP-bound post-nucleosomal histones accumulate and chromatin is depleted of H3K4me3-modified histones.

  abstract = {CTCF has it all. The transcription factor binds to tens of thousands of genomic sites, some tissue-specific, others ultra-conserved. It can act as a transcriptional activator, repressor and insulator, and it can pause transcription. CTCF binds at chromatin domain boundaries, at enhancers and gene promoters, and inside gene bodies. It can attract many other transcription factors to chromatin, including tissue-specific transcriptional activators, repressors, cohesin and RNA polymerase II, and it forms chromatin loops. Yet, or perhaps therefore, CTCF's exact function at a given genomic site is unpredictable. It appears to be determined by the associated transcription factors, by the location of the binding site relative to the transcriptional start site of a gene, and by the site's engagement in chromatin loops with other CTCF-binding sites, enhancers or gene promoters. Here, we will discuss genome-wide features of CTCF binding events, as well as locus-specific functions of this remarkable transcription factor.},

Here we generate a comprehensive set of epigenome reference maps, which we use to determine the extent to which maternal factors shape chromatin state in Xenopus embryos. Using {$\alpha$}-amanitin to inhibit zygotic transcription, we find that the majority of H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-enriched regions form a maternally defined epigenetic regulatory space with an underlying logic of hypomethylated islands. This maternal regulatory space extends to a substantial proportion of neurula stage-activated promoters. In contrast, p300 recruitment to distal regulatory regions requires embryonic transcription at most loci. The results show that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are part of a regulatory space that exerts an extended maternal control well into post-gastrulation development, and highlight the combinatorial action of maternal and zygotic factors through proximal and distal regulatory sequences.},

  abstract = {Oncogenic signaling pathways regulate gene expression in part through epigenetic modification of chromatin including DNA methylation and histone modification. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27), which correlates with transcriptional repression, is regulated by an oncogenic form of the small GTPase Ras. Although accumulation of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, it remains unclear whether Ras-induced changes in H3K27me3 are a trigger for or a consequence of changes in transcriptional activity. We have now examined the relation between H3K27 trimethylation and transcriptional regulation by Ras. Genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 distribution and transcription at various times after expression of oncogenic Ras in mouse NIH 3T3 cells identified 115 genes for which H3K27me3 level at the gene body and transcription were both regulated by Ras. Similarly, 196 genes showed Ras-induced changes in transcription and H3K27me3 level in the region around the transcription start site. The Ras-induced changes in transcription occurred before those in H3K27me3 at the genome-wide level, a finding that was validated by analysis of individual genes. Depletion of H3K27me3 either before or after activation of Ras signaling did not affect the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Furthermore, given that H3K27me3 enrichment was dependent on Ras signaling, neither it nor transcriptional repression was maintained after inactivation of such signaling. Unexpectedly, we detected unannotated transcripts derived from intergenic regions at which the H3K27me3 level is regulated by Ras, with the changes in transcript abundance again preceding those in H3K27me3. Our results thus indicate that changes in H3K27me3 level in the gene body or in the region around the transcription start site are not a trigger for, but rather a consequence of, changes in transcriptional activity.},

Because of this association, H3K4me3 is often described as an `activating' histone modification and assumed to have an instructive role in the transcription of genes, but the field is lacking a conserved mechanism to support this view. The overwhelming finding from genome-wide studies is that actually very little transcription changes upon removal of most H3K4me3 under steady-state or dynamically changing conditions, including at mammalian CpG island promoters. Instead, rather than a major role in instructing transcription, time-resolved experiments provide more evidence supporting the deposition of H3K4me3 into chromatin as a result of transcription, influencing processes such as memory of previous states, transcriptional consistency between cells in a population and transcription termination.},

Interestingly, some TFs exhibit specific binding activity to methylated and unmethylated DNA motifs of distinct sequences. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focused on Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and decoupled its mCpG- and CpG-binding activities via site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, KLF4 binds specific methylated or unmethylated motifs in human embryonic stem cells in vivo. Our study suggests that mCpG-dependent TF binding activity is a widespread phenomenon and provides a new framework to understand the role and mechanism of TFs in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.},

To investigate when spatial genome organization is first established during development, we examined chromatin conformation during Drosophila embryogenesis and observed the emergence of chromatin architecture within a tight time window that coincides with the onset of transcription activation in the zygote. Prior to zygotic genome activation, the genome is mostly unstructured. Early expressed genes serve as nucleation sites for topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Activation of gene expression coincides with the establishment of TADs throughout the genome and co-localization of housekeeping gene clusters, which remain stable in subsequent stages of development. However, the appearance of TAD boundaries is independent of transcription and requires the transcription factor Zelda for locus-specific TAD boundary insulation. These results offer insight into when spatial organization of the genome emerges and identify a key factor that helps trigger this architecture.},

However, promoter PcG marks are erased after fertilization and de novo established in peri-implantation embryos, coinciding with the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for this establishment remains unknown. In this study, we show that the expression of the long KDM2B isoform (KDM2BLF), which contains the demethylase domain, is specifically induced at peri-implantation and that its H3K36me2 demethylase activity is required for PcG enrichment at CGIs. Moreover, KDM2BLF interacts with BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) and stabilizes BAF occupancy at CGIs for subsequent gain of accessibility, which precedes PcG enrichment. Consistently, KDM2BLF inactivation results in significantly delayed post-implantation development. In summary, our data unveil dynamic chromatin configuration of CGIs during exit from naive pluripotency and provide a conceptual framework for the spatiotemporal establishment of PcG functions.},

We observe that PRC1 is highly dynamic, with only a small fraction stably interacting with chromatin. By integrating subunit-specific dynamics, chromatin binding, and abundance measurements, we discover that PRC1 exhibits low occupancy at target sites. Furthermore, we employ perturbation approaches to uncover how specific components of PRC1 define its kinetics and chromatin binding. Together, these discoveries provide a quantitative understanding of chromatin binding by PRC1 in live cells, suggesting that chromatin modification, as opposed to PRC1 complex occupancy, is central to gene repression.},

In Drosophila, the pioneer factor Zelda is known to be essential for the progression of development; still, it regulates the activation of only a small subset of genes at ZGA. However, thousands of genes do not require Zelda, suggesting that other mechanisms exist. By conducting GRO-seq, HiC and ChIP-seq in Drosophila embryos, we demonstrate that up to 65\% of zygotically activated genes are enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z. H2A.Z enrichment precedes ZGA and RNA Polymerase II loading onto chromatin. In vivo knockdown of maternally contributed Domino, a histone chaperone and ATPase, reduces H2A.Z deposition at transcription start sites, causes global downregulation of housekeeping genes at ZGA, and compromises the establishment of the 3D chromatin structure. We infer that H2A.Z is essential for the de novo establishment of transcriptional programs during ZGA via chromatin reorganization.},

Further dissection demonstrated that both canonical and non-canonical PRC1 complexes bind to repressed genes, marked by H2AK119ub and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3. Interestingly, loss of canonical PRC1, PRC1 catalytic activity, or PRC2 leads to expansion of mechanosensitive Merkel cells in neonatal skin. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes, however, also bind to and promote expression of genes critical for skin development and SC formation. Together, our findings highlight PRC1's diverse roles in executing a precise developmental program.}

It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active.},

  abstract = {The oocyte is a unique cell type that undergoes extensive chromosome changes on its way to fertilization, but the chromatin determinants of its fate are unknown. Here, we show that Polycomb group (PcG) proteins of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) determine the fate of the oocyte in Drosophila. Mutation of the enzymatic PRC2 subunit Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) in the germline abolishes spatial and temporal control of the cell cycle and induces sterility via transdetermination of the oocyte into a nurse-like cell. This fate switch depends on loss of silencing of two PRC2 target genes, Cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dacapo. By contrast, the PRC1 component Polycomb (Pc) plays no role in this process. Our results demonstrate that PRC2 plays an exquisite role in the determination of the oocyte fate by preventing its switching into an endoreplicative program.},

We propose a role for SAM domain polymerization in this repression by two distinct mechanisms: first, through capturing and/or retaining PRC1 at the PcG targets, and second, by strengthening the interactions between PRC1 and PRC2 to stabilize transcriptional repression. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism mediated by SAM domain polymerization for PcG-mediated repression of developmental loci that enables a robust yet reversible gene repression program during development.},

Recent studies have shown that pioneer factors are also crucial for cellular reprogramming and that they are implicated in the marked changes in gene regulatory networks that occur in various cancers. Here, we provide an overview of the contexts in which pioneer factors function, how they can target silent genes, and their limitations at regions of heterochromatin.

The selection vectors, pCoHYGRO and pCoBLAST, are commercially available using hygromycin-B and blasticidin S, respectively. Recently, we generated a plasmid, pCoPURO, for selection of transfected S2 cells using puromycin, which allows significant acceleration of the selection time. Although co-transfection of the selection marker with the plasmid for heterologous protein expression is functional in stable expression at short culture periods, the expression levels of stable transformants are continuously decreased during long culture times. To overcome this limitation, we generated pMT-PURO, a new plasmid that contains both the expression cassette and puromycin selection marker in a single plasmid. This system allows rapid selection and maintenance of the transformed S2 lines for extended culture periods.},

How PRC1, which consists of canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) and variant PRC1 (vPRC1) complexes, and PRC2 cooperate to silence genes and support mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal is unclear. Using combinatorial genetic perturbations, we show that independent pathways of cPRC1 and vPRC1 are responsible for maintenance of H2A monoubiquitylation and silencing of shared target genes. Individual loss of PRC2-dependent cPRC1 or PRC2-independent vPRC1 disrupts only one pathway and does not impair mESC self-renewal capacity. However, loss of both pathways leads to mESC differentiation and activation of a subset of lineage-specific genes co-occupied by relatively high levels of PRC1/PRC2. Thus, parallel pathways explain the differential requirements for PRC1 and PRC2 and provide robust silencing of lineage-specific genes.},

  abstract = {Histone methylation can occur at various sites in histone proteins, primarily on lysine and arginine residues, and it can be governed by multiple positive and negative regulators, even at a single site, to either activate or repress transcription. It is now apparent that histone methylation is critical for almost all stages of development, and its proper regulation is essential for ensuring the coordinated expression of gene networks that govern pluripotency, body patterning and differentiation along appropriate lineages and organogenesis. Notably, developmental histone methylation is highly dynamic. Early embryonic systems display unique histone methylation patterns, prominently including the presence of bivalent (both gene-activating and gene-repressive) marks at lineage-specific genes that resolve to monovalent marks during differentiation, which ensures that appropriate genes are expressed in each tissue type. Studies of the effects of methylation on embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation have helped to elucidate the developmental roles of histone methylation. It has been revealed that methylation and demethylation of both activating and repressive marks are essential for establishing embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, for ensuring gene dosage compensation via genomic imprinting and for establishing body patterning via HOX gene regulation. Not surprisingly, aberrant methylation during embryogenesis can lead to defects in body patterning and in the development of specific organs. Human genetic disorders arising from mutations in histone methylation regulators have revealed their important roles in the developing skeletal and nervous systems, and they highlight the overlapping and unique roles of different patterns of methylation in ensuring proper development.},

In addition to genes known to be important for eye development and to known and novel components of the Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic, Wingless, Epidermal growth factor receptor, and Notch signaling pathways, we identified several members of the Polycomb and trithorax classes of genes encoding general transcriptional regulators. Mutations in these genes disrupt the transitions between zones along the anterior-posterior axis of the eye disc that express different combinations of transcription factors. Different trithorax group genes have very different mutant phenotypes, indicating that target genes differ in their requirements for chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and coactivation factors.},

Thus, profiling the chromatin state of different cell types in an intact organism under disease or physiological conditions can provide insight into how chromatin regulates cell homeostasis in vivo. To overcome the many challenges associated with characterizing chromatin state in specific cell types, we developed an improved approach to isolate Drosophila melanogaster nuclei tagged with a GFPKASH protein. The perinuclear space-localized KASH domain anchors GFP to the outer nuclear membrane, and expression of UAS-GFPKASH can be controlled by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers. Using this protocol, we profiled chromatin accessibility using an improved version of Assay for Transposable Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq), called Omni-ATAC. In addition, we examined the distribution of histone marks using Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&amp;Tag) in adult photoreceptor neurons. We show that the chromatin landscape of photoreceptors reflects the transcriptional state of these cells, demonstrating the quality and reproducibility of our approach for profiling the transcriptome and epigenome of specific cell types in Drosophila.},

PRC2 also facilitates the inheritance of this hPTM through its self-contained "write and read" activities, key to preserving cellular identity during cell division. As these changes in gene expression occur without changes in DNA sequence and are inherited, the process is epigenetic in scope. Mutants of mammalian PRC2 or of its histone substrate contribute to the cancer process and other diseases, and research into these aberrant pathways is yielding viable candidates for therapeutic targeting. The effectiveness of PRC2 hinges on its being recruited to the proper chromatin sites; however, resolving the determinants to this process in the mammalian case was not straightforward and thus piqued the interest of many in the field.

However, it remains largely unknown how mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is established and stably propagated during cell division. In this study, we found that the proteins RYBP and YAF2 each specifically bind H2AK119ub1 to recruit the RYBP\textendash PRC1 or YAF2\textendash PRC1 complex to catalyse the ubiquitination of H2A on neighbouring nucleosomes through a positive-feedback model. Additionally, we demonstrated that histone H1-compacted chromatin enhances the distal propagation of H2AK119ub1, thereby reinforcing the inheritance of H2AK119ub1 during cell division. Moreover, we showed that either disruption of RYBP/YAF2\textendash PRC1 activity or impairment of histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction resulted in a significant defect of the maintenance of H2AK119ub1. Therefore, our results suggest that histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction plays a critical role in the stable propagation of H2AK119ub1 by RYBP/YAF2\textendash PRC1 during cell division. Zhao et al. show that H2AK119ub1 is propagated during cell division through positive feedback mediated by the variant PRC1 complex containing RYBP or YAF2 and promoted by histone H1-mediated chromatin compaction.},

  abstract = {The Enhancer of zeste [E(z)] locus of Drosophila melanogaster is implicated in multiple examples of gene regulation during development. First identified as dominant gain-of-function modifiers of the zeste1-white (z-w) interaction, mutant E(z) alleles also produce homeotic transformations. Reduction of E(z)+ activity leads to both suppression of the z-w interaction and ectopic expression of segment identity genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax gene complexes. This latter effect defines E(z) as a member of the Polycomb-group of genes. Analysis of E(z)S2, a temperature-sensitive E(z) allele, reveals that both maternally and zygotically produced E(z)+ activity is required to correctly regulate the segment identity genes during embryonic and imaginal development. As has been shown for other Polycomb-group genes, E(z)+ is required not to initiate the pattern of these genes, but rather to maintain their repressed state. We propose that the E(z) loss-of-function eye color and homeotic phenotypes may both be due to gene derepression, and that the E(z)+ product may be a general repressing factor required for both examples of negative gene regulation.},

  abstract = {The protein repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor/neuron restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) is a negative regulator of neuronal genes that contain a particular DNA sequence, the neuron restrictive silencer element (NRSE). REST is expressed ubiquitously in non-neural tissues but is down-regulated in neural precursors and turned off in postmitotic neurons, suggesting that it can act both to prevent extraneural expression of certain genes and to delay the differentiation of neuronal subtypes. In a recent paper, Chen et al.(1) describe the production of a null mutant for REST in mice and the mosaic inactivation of REST function in chicken embryos. Knockout of REST led to malformations in several non-neural tissues, as well as apoptosis and embryonic lethality in mice. In addition, the expression of several REST target genes was derepressed in non-neural tissues and in neural progenitors in both mouse and chicken embryos. These studies clearly demonstrate that active repression of tissue-specific genes is required for proper tissue differentiation during embryonic development.

The confocal microscope's ability to block out-of-focus light and thereby perform optical sectioning through a specimen allows the researcher to quantify fluorescence with very high spatial precision. However, generating meaningful data using confocal microscopy requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of the technique. In this tutorial, the researcher is guided through all aspects of acquiring quantitative confocal microscopy images, including optimizing sample preparation for fixed and live cells, choosing the most suitable microscope for a given application and configuring the microscope parameters. Suggestions are offered for planning unbiased and rigorous confocal microscope experiments. Common pitfalls such as photobleaching and cross-talk are addressed, as well as several troubling instrumentation problems that may prevent the acquisition of quantitative data. Finally, guidelines for analyzing and presenting confocal images in a way that maintains the quantitative nature of the data are presented, and statistical analysis is discussed.

We review the results of genetic analyses that show that human genetic variation is geographically structured, in accord with historical patterns of gene flow and genetic drift. Analysis of many loci now yields reasonably accurate estimates of genetic similarity among individuals, rather than populations. Clustering of individuals is correlated with geographic origin or ancestry. These clusters are also correlated with some traditional concepts of race, but the correlations are imperfect because genetic variation tends to be distributed in a continuous, overlapping fashion among populations. Therefore, ancestry, or even race, may in some cases prove useful in the biomedical setting, but direct assessment of disease-related genetic variation will ultimately yield more accurate and beneficial information.},

Despite the importance, few studies have been focused on the regulation of PcG activity itself. Here, we report a  Drosophila  gene,  stuxnet  ( stx ), that controls Pc protein stability. We find that heightened  stx  activity leads to homeotic transformation, reduced  Pc  activity, and de-repression of PcG targets. Conversely,  stx  mutants, which can be rescued by decreased  Pc  expression, display developmental defects resembling hyperactivation of  Pc . Our biochemical analyses provide a mechanistic basis for the interaction between  stx  and  Pc ; Stx facilitates Pc degradation in the proteasome, independent of ubiquitin modification. Furthermore, this mode of regulation is conserved in vertebrates. Mouse  stx  promotes degradation of Cbx4, an orthologous Pc protein, in vertebrate cells and induces homeotic transformation in  Drosophila . Our results highlight an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of regulated protein degradation on PcG homeostasis and epigenetic activity.}

The SUMOylation pathway influences several nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. The expression of many genes, in particular those involved in development is finely tuned in space and time by several groups of proteins. There is growing evidence that transcriptional regulation mechanisms involve direct SUMOylation of transcriptional-related proteins such as initiation and elongation factors, and subunits of chromatin modifier and remodeling complexes originally described as members of the trithorax and Polycomb groups in Drosophila. Therefore it is being unveiled that SUMOylation has a role in both, gene silencing and gene activation mechanisms. The goal of this review is to discuss the information on how SUMO modification in components of these multi-subunit complexes may have an effect in genome architecture and function and therefore in the regulation of gene expression in time and space.

Mutations in trans-regulatory genes such as Polycomb (Pc)2 or extra sex combs (esc)3 cause indiscriminate expression of the BX-C genes, which leads to all body segments being abdominal. I report here on mutations in four other trans-regulatory genes, members of a novel class of more than 20 genes controlling the spatial expression of BX-C genes. In contrast to Pc and esc mutations, only partial transformation into posterior abdominal development is observed in mutant embryos. However, embryos mutant for two or more of these genes show strong homoeotic transformation of all body segments similar to, or stronger than, that seen in Pc and esc embryos, indicating that these genes act synergistically in normal development to control the spatial expression of the BX-C genes.},

We show that H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 is found on the entire Ubx gene silenced by Polycomb. However, Enhancer of Zeste and other Polycomb group proteins stay primarily localized at their response elements, which appear to be the least methylated parts of the silenced gene. Our results suggest that, contrary to the prevailing view, the Polycomb group proteins and methyltransferase complexes are recruited to the Polycomb response elements independently of histone methylation and then loop over to scan the entire region, methylating all accessible nucleosomes. We propose that the Polycomb chromodomain is required for the looping mechanism that spreads methylation over a broad domain, which in turn is required for the stability of the Polycomb group protein complex. Both the spread of methylation from the Polycomb response elements, and the silencing effect can be blocked by the gypsy insulator.},

  abstract = {Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic repressors that control metazoan development and cell differentiation. In Drosophila, PcG proteins form five distinct complexes targeted to genes by Polycomb Response Elements (PREs). Of all PcG complexes PhoRC is the only one that contains a sequence-specific DNA binding subunit (PHO or PHOL), which led to a model that places PhoRC at the base of the recruitment hierarchy. Here we demonstrate that in vivo PHO is preferred to PHOL as a subunit of PhoRC and that PHO and PHOL associate with PREs and a subset of transcriptionally active promoters. Although the binding to the promoter sites depends on the quality of recognition sequences, the binding to PREs does not. Instead, the efficient recruitment of PhoRC to PREs requires the SFMBT subunit and crosstalk with Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. We find that human YY1 protein, the ortholog of PHO, binds sites at active promoters in the human genome but does not bind most PcG target genes, presumably because the interactions involved in the targeting to Drosophila PREs are lost in the mammalian lineage. We conclude that the recruitment of PhoRC to PREs is based on combinatorial interactions and propose that such a recruitment strategy is important to attenuate the binding of PcG proteins when the target genes are transcriptionally active. Our findings allow the appropriate placement of PhoRC in the PcG recruitment hierarchy and provide a rationale to explain why YY1 is unlikely to serve as a general recruiter of mammalian Polycomb complexes despite its reported ability to participate in PcG repression in flies.},

The targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 is poorly understood and was proposed to be hierarchical and involve tri-methylation of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and/or monoubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2AK118ub). Here, we present a strict test of this hypothesis using the Drosophila model. We discover that neither H3K27me3 nor H2AK118ub is required for targeting PRC complexes to Polycomb Response Elements (PREs). We find that PRC1 can bind PREs in the absence of PRC2 but at many PREs PRC2 requires PRC1 to be targeted. We show that one role of H3K27me3 is to allow PcG complexes anchored at PREs to interact with surrounding chromatin. In contrast, the bulk of H2AK118ub is unrelated to PcG repression. These findings radically change our view of how PcG repression is targeted and suggest that PRC1 and PRC2 can communicate independently of histone modifications.},

  abstract = {Analysis of gene function in complex organisms relies extensively on tools to detect the cellular and subcellular localization of gene products, especially proteins. Typically, immunostaining with antibodies provides these data. However, due to cost, time, and labor limitations, generating specific antibodies against all proteins of a complex organism is not feasible. Furthermore, antibodies do not enable live imaging studies of protein dynamics. Hence, tagging genes with standardized immunoepitopes or fluorescent tags that permit live imaging has become popular. Importantly, tagging genes present in large genomic clones or at their endogenous locus often reports proper expression, subcellular localization, and dynamics of the encoded protein. Moreover, these tagging approaches allow the generation of elegant protein removal strategies, standardization of visualization protocols, and permit protein interaction studies using mass spectrometry. Here, we summarize available genomic resources and techniques to tag genes and discuss relevant applications that are rarely, if at all, possible with antibodies.},

The method relied on double stranded DNA (dsDNA) homology donors with \textasciitilde 1 kb homology arms. Here, we describe three new simpler ways to edit genes in flies. We create single stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors using PCR and add 100 nt of homology on each side of an integration cassette, followed by enzymatic removal of one strand. Using this method, we generated GFP-tagged proteins that mark organelles in S2 cells. We then describe two dsDNA methods using cheap synthesized donors flanked by 100 nt homology arms and gRNA target sites cloned into a plasmid. Upon injection, donor DNA (1 to 5 kb) is released from the plasmid by Cas9. The cassette integrates efficiently and precisely in vivo. The approach is fast, cheap, and scalable.},

How PcG complexes form repressive chromatin domains remains unclear. Using cross-linked affinity purifications of BioTAP-Polycomb (Pc) or BioTAP-Enhancer of zeste [E(z)], we captured all PcG-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) or PRC2 core components and Sex comb on midleg (Scm) as the only protein strongly enriched with both complexes. Although previously not linked to PRC2, we confirmed direct binding of Scm and PRC2 using recombinant protein expression and colocalization of Scm with PRC1, PRC2, and H3K27me3 in embryos and cultured cells using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing). Furthermore, we found that RNAi knockdown of Scm and overexpression of the dominant-negative Scm-SAM (sterile {$\alpha$} motif) domain both affected the binding pattern of E(z) on polytene chromosomes. Aberrant localization of the Scm-SAM domain in long contiguous regions on polytene chromosomes revealed its independent ability to spread on chromatin, consistent with its previously described ability to oligomerize in vitro. Pull-downs of BioTAP-Scm captured PRC1 and PRC2 and additional repressive complexes, including PhoRC, LINT, and CtBP. We propose that Scm is a key mediator connecting PRC1, PRC2, and transcriptional silencing. Combined with previous structural and genetic analyses, our results strongly suggest that Scm coordinates PcG complexes and polymerizes to produce broad domains of PcG silencing.},

Since PcG and TrxG are ubiquitous and lack apparent sequence specificity, a long-standing model is that targeting occurs via protein interactions; for instance, between repressors and PcG proteins. Instead, we found that Pc-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) purifies with coactivators Fs(1)h [female sterile (1) homeotic] and Enok/Br140 during embryogenesis. Fs(1)h is a TrxG member and the ortholog of BRD4, a bromodomain protein that binds to acetylated histones and is a key transcriptional coactivator in mammals. Enok and Br140, another bromodomain protein, are orthologous to subunits of a mammalian MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase complex. Here we confirm PRC1\textendash Br140 and PRC1\textendash Fs(1)h interactions and identify their genomic binding sites. PRC1\textendash Br140 bind developmental genes in fly embryos, with analogous co-occupancy of PRC1 and a Br140 ortholog, BRD1, at bivalent loci in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We propose that identification of PRC1\textendash Br140 ``bivalent complexes'' in fly embryos supports and extends the bivalency model posited in mammalian cells, in which the coexistence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at developmental promoters represents a poised transcriptional state. We further speculate that local competition between acetylation and deacetylation may play a critical role in the resolution of bivalent protein complexes during development.},

Till now, plenty of EZH2 small molecule inhibitors have been developed and some of them have already been tested in clinical trials. Most of these inhibitors, however, are effective only in limited cases in the context of EZH2 gain-of-function mutated tumors such as lymphomas. Other cancer types with aberrant EZH2 expression and function require alternative approaches for successful treatment. One possibility is to exploit synthetic lethal strategy, which is based on the phenomenon that concurrent loss of two genes is detrimental but the deletion of either of them leaves cell viable. In the context of EZH2/PRC2, the most promising synthetic lethal target seems to be SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable chromatin remodeling complex (SWI/SNF), which is known to counteract PRC2 functions. SWI/SNF is heavily involved in carcinogenesis and its subunits have been found mutated in approximately 20\% of tumors of different kinds. In the current review, we summarize the existing knowledge of synthetic lethal relationships between EZH2/PRC2 and components of the SWI/SNF complex and discuss in detail the potential application of existing EZH2 inhibitors in cancer patients harboring mutations in SWI/SNF proteins. We also highlight recent discoveries of EZH2 involvement in tumor microenvironment regulation and consequences for future therapies. Although clinical studies are limited, the fundamental research might help to understand which patients are most likely to benefit from therapies using EZH2 inhibitors.}

  abstract = {Every organism develops body patterns that are accurately repeated among individuals of the same species. To understand how cells interact to form these patterns, many investigators have studied the re-establishment of patterns following genetic and/or physical perturbations. In regulating systems, missing structures may be replaced by cell proliferation (epimorphosis) or by respecification without growth (morphallaxis)1. Epimorphosis involves the formation and growth of a blastema2, defined for vertebrate regeneration as a zone of proliferating cells, localized near the wound surface3, which becomes capable of regenerating even when isolated from the rest of the limb4. Clonal analysis of Drosophila imaginal disk fragments indicates that during pattern regulation most dividing cells are located near the wound surface5. Furthermore, mitotic figures (L. C. Abbott, personal communication) and cells incorporating 3H-thymidine6 are clustered near the wound surface of regulating fragments. Here we describe experiments involving cultures of this zone of proliferating cells, and report that it can regulate in isolation. These observations provide evidence that regulation of disk fragments is accomplished by growth of a blastema. Surprisingly, the isolated blastema regenerated more pattern elements than predicted by the polar coordinate model7. We resolve this paradox by proposing that regulation is initiated at free cut edges, where a blastema is formed that adds new positional values in a sequence. On completion of wound healing, blastema growth continues until remaining positional disparities are eliminated by intercalation, as presented in the polar coordinate model.},

This suppression is dependent on the presence of two copies of engrailed DNA-containing P elements (P[en]) in proximity in the Drosophila genome (either in cis or in trans). In this study, the 2-kb fragment was dissected and found to contain three fragments of DNA which could mediate white suppression [called "pairing-sensitive sites" (PS)]. A PS site was also identified in regulatory DNA from the Drosophila escargot gene. The eye colors of six different P[en] insertions in the escargot gene suggest an interaction between P[en]-encoded and genome-encoded PS sites. I hypothesize that white gene expression from P[en] is repressed by the formation of a protein complex which is initiated at the engrailed PS sites and also requires interactions with flanking genomic DNA. Genes were sought which influence the function of PS sites. Mutations in some Polycomb and trithorax group genes were found to affect the eye color from some P[en] insertion sites. However, different mutations affected expression from different P[en] insertion sites and no one mutation was found to affect expression from all P[en] insertion sites examined. These results suggest that white expression from P[en] is not directly regulated by members of the Polycomb and trithorax group genes, but in some cases can be influenced by them. I propose that engrailed PS sites normally act to promote interactions between distantly located engrailed regulatory sites and the engrailed promoter.},

PcG proteins are present in all metazoans and are best characterized as transcriptional repressors. In Drosophila, these proteins are known as epigenetic regulators because they remember, but do not establish, the patterned expression state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins, in general, are not DNA binding proteins, but act in protein complexes to repress transcription at specific target genes. How are PcG proteins recruited to the DNA? In Drosophila, there are specific regulatory DNA elements called Polycomb group response elements (PREs) that bring PcG protein complexes to the DNA. Drosophila PREs are made up of binding sites for a complex array of DNA binding proteins. Functional PRE assays in transgenes have shown that PREs act in the context of other regulatory DNA and PRE activity is highly dependent on genomic context. Drosophila PREs tend to regulate genes with a complex array of regulatory DNA in a cell or tissue-specific fashion and it is the interplay between regulatory DNA that dictates PRE function. In mammals, PcG proteins are more diverse and there are multiple ways to recruit PcG complexes, including RNA-mediated recruitment. In this review, we discuss evidence for PREs in vertebrates and explore similarities and differences between Drosophila and vertebrate PREs.},

  abstract = {Many chromatin features play critical roles in regulating gene expression. A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

  abstract = {Compartmentalization by liquid-liquid phase separation is implicated in transcription. It remains unclear whether and how transcriptional condensates accelerate the search of transcriptional regulatory factors for their target sites. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which regulatory factors nucleate on chromatin to assemble transcriptional condensates remain incompletely understood. The CBX-PRC1 complexes compartmentalize key developmental regulators for repression through phase-separated condensates driven by the chromobox 2 (CBX2) protein. Here, by using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we show that CBX2 nucleates on chromatin independently of H3K27me3 and CBX-PRC1. The interactions between CBX2 and DNA are essential for nucleating CBX-PRC1 on chromatin to assemble condensates. The assembled condensates shorten 3D diffusion time and reduce trials for finding specific sites through revisiting the same or adjacent sites repetitively, thereby accelerating CBX2 in searching for target sites. Overall, our data suggest a generic mechanism by which transcriptional regulatory factors nucleate to assemble condensates that accelerate their target-search process.},

Here we present a genome-wide chromatin landscape for Drosophila melanogaster based on eighteen histone modifications, summarized by nine prevalent combinatorial patterns. Integrative analysis with other data (non-histone chromatin proteins, DNase I hypersensitivity, GRO-Seq reads produced by engaged polymerase, short/long RNA products) reveals discrete characteristics of chromosomes, genes, regulatory elements and other functional domains. We find that active genes display distinct chromatin signatures that are correlated with disparate gene lengths, exon patterns, regulatory functions and genomic contexts. We also demonstrate a diversity of signatures among Polycomb targets that include a subset with paused polymerase. This systematic profiling and integrative analysis of chromatin signatures provides insights into how genomic elements are regulated, and will serve as a resource for future experimental investigations of genome structure and function.},

In vitro experiments have shown that PcG protein complexes can compact chromatin to limit the activity of chromatin remodeling enzymes and access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. In fitting with these ideas, gene promoters associated with PcG proteins have been reported to be less accessible than other gene promoters. However, it remains largely untested in vivo whether PcG proteins define chromatin accessibility or other chromatin features. To address this important question, we examine the chromatin accessibility and nucleosome landscape at PcG protein-bound promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. Combined with genetic ablation strategies, we unexpectedly discover that although PcG protein-occupied gene promoters exhibit reduced accessibility, this does not rely on PcG proteins. Instead, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) appears to play a unique role in driving elevated nucleosome occupancy and decreased nucleosomal spacing in Polycomb chromatin domains. Our new genome-scale observations argue, in contrast to the prevailing view, that PcG proteins do not significantly affect chromatin accessibility and highlight an underappreciated complexity in the relationship between chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome landscape, and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression.},

We analyzed the expression profiles of cells induced by ectopic Wingless expression to transdetermine from leg to wing by dissecting transdetermined cells and hybridizing probes generated by linear RNA amplification to DNA microarrays. Changes in expression levels implicated a number of genes: lamina ancestor, CG12534 (a gene orthologous to mouse augmenter of liver regeneration), Notch pathway members, and the Polycomb and trithorax groups of chromatin regulators. Functional tests revealed that transdetermination was significantly affected in mutants for lama and seven different PcG and trxG genes. These results validate our methods for expression profiling as a way to analyze developmental programs, and show that modifications to chromatin structure are key to changes in cell fate. Our findings are likely to be relevant to the mechanisms that lead to disease when homologs of Wingless are expressed at abnormal levels and to the manifestation of pluripotency of stem cells.},

The genesNotch(N) andwingless(wg) play an important role in generating the information from the dorsoventral axis.

Our results reveal thatvgis involved in the specification of the wing primordium under the combined control of Notch and wingless signaling. Furthermore, we show that once cells are assigned to the wing fate, their development relies on a sequence of regulatory loops that involveN, wg,andvg.During this process, cells that are exposed to the activity of bothwgandvgwill become wing blade and those that are continuously under the influence ofwgalone will develop as hinge. Our results also indicate that the growth of the cells in the wing blade results from a synergistic effect of the three genesN, wg,andvgon the cells that have been specified as wing blade.},

  abstract = {The vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila plays a central role in the development and patterning of the wing: loss of vestigial results in failures in wing development and ectopic expression of vestigial leads to the development of ectopic wings. The wing-specific regulation of vestigial is mediated through two enhancers: (1) the Boundary Enhancer (vgBE) is early acting and becomes restricted to the wing margin, and (2) the Quadrant Enhancer (vgQE), acts later and is responsible for the expression of vestigial in the developing wing blade. These enhancers receive regulatory inputs from three signalling pathways: wingless, decapentaplegic and Notch/Suppressor of Hairless. Our experiments show that the vestigial gene product is also an input in the regulation of vestigial expression. In particular, Vestigial provides an important input for the regulation of the activity of the vgQE acting in concert with Wingless and Decapentaplegic. Our results suggest how interactions between vgBE and the vgQE mediated by Vestigial can explain the interactions between the wing margin and the wing blade during the growth of the wing. We further show that Vestigial and Notch collaborate with Wingless to subdivide and pattern the wing blade. These results lead us to propose a general role for Wingless during development in which it stabilizes cell fate decisions that have been implemented by other molecules.},

The trxG proteins Ash1 and hTRX and the PcG repressor E(z) are histone methyltransferases (HMTases) that methylate distinct lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histone H3. trxG proteins are generally thought to function as activators of HOX genes, but how histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx promotes HOX gene transcription is not clear. Here, we show that in ash1 and trx mutants expression of HOX genes is lost within their normal expression domains, but we find that, contrary to expectation, this expression is restored in ash1 and trx mutants that also lack PcG gene function. Moreover, such trxG PcG double mutants show severe misexpression of HOX genes and, hence, ectopic activation of HOX genes caused by the removal of PcG gene function also occurs in the absence of ash1 and trx function. Together, these results suggest that the Ash1 and Trx HMTases are not ?coactivators? required for transcriptional activation of HOX genes, but function specifically as anti-repressors. We propose that histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx is required continuously throughout development to prevent inappropriate PcG silencing of HOX genes in cells in which they must stay transcriptionally active.},

To gain insight into the function of Pho, we purified Pho protein complexes from Drosophila embryos and found that Pho exists in two distinct protein assemblies: a Pho\textendash dINO80 complex containing the Drosophila INO80 nucleosome-remodeling complex, and a Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) containing the uncharacterized gene product dSfmbt. Analysis of PhoRC reveals that dSfmbt is a novel PcG protein that is essential for HOX gene repression in Drosophila. PhoRC is bound at HOX gene PREs in vivo, and this targeting strictly depends on Pho-binding sites. Characterization of dSfmbt protein shows that its MBT repeats have unique discriminatory binding activity for methylated lysine residues in histones H3 and H4; the MBT repeats bind mono- and di-methylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 but fail to interact with these residues if they are unmodified or tri-methylated. Our results establish PhoRC as a novel Drosophila PcG protein complex that combines DNA-targeting activity (Pho) with a unique modified histone-binding activity (dSfmbt). We propose that PRE-tethered PhoRC selectively interacts with methylated histones in the chromatin flanking PREs to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state.},

  abstract = {Many developmental regulators have complex and context-specific roles in different tissues and stages, making the dissection of their function extremely challenging. As regulatory processes often occur within minutes, perturbation methods that match these dynamics are needed. Here, we present the improved light-inducible nuclear export system (iLEXY), an optogenetic loss-of-function approach that triggers translocation of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. By introducing a series of mutations, we substantially increased LEXY's efficiency and generated variants with different recovery times. iLEXY enables rapid (t1/2~{$<$} 30 s), efficient, and reversible nuclear protein depletion in embryos, and is generalizable to proteins of diverse sizes and functions. Applying iLEXY to the Drosophila master regulator Twist, we phenocopy loss-of-function mutants, precisely map the Twist-sensitive embryonic stages, and investigate the effects of timed Twist depletions. Our results demonstrate the power of iLEXY to dissect the function of pleiotropic factors during embryogenesis with unprecedented temporal precision.},

The Drosophila melanogaster genome has a single locus comprised of {$\sim$}100 copies of a tandemly arrayed 5-kB repeat unit containing one copy of each of the 5 RD histone genes. To determine sequence elements required for D. melanogaster HLB formation and histone gene expression, we used transgenic gene arrays containing 12 copies of the histone repeat unit that functionally complement loss of the {$\sim$}200 endogenous RD histone genes. A 12x histone gene array in which all H3-H4 promoters were replaced with H2a-H2b promoters (12xPR) does not form an HLB or express high levels of RD histone mRNA in the presence of the endogenous histone genes. In contrast, this same transgenic array is active in HLB assembly and RD histone gene expression in the absence of the endogenous RD histone genes and rescues the lethality caused by homozygous deletion of the RD histone locus. The HLB formed in the absence of endogenous RD histone genes on the mutant 12x array contains all known factors present in the wild-type HLB including CLAMP, which normally binds to GAGA repeats in the H3-H4 promoter. These data suggest that multiple protein\textendash protein and/or protein\textendash DNA interactions contribute to HLB formation, and that the large number of endogenous RD histone gene copies sequester available factor(s) from attenuated transgenic arrays, thereby preventing HLB formation and gene expression on these arrays.},

It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes\textemdash the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding. This analysis revealed that the genomewide locations of PRC2 and PRC1 can be largely predicted from the locations, sizes, and underlying motif contents of CpG islands. We propose that large CpG islands depleted of activating motifs confer epigenetic memory by recruiting the full repertoire of Polycomb complexes in pluripotent cells.},

Some PcG proteins covalently modify histones, which contributes to heritable repression. The role for other effects on chromatin structure is less understood. We characterized the organization of PcG target genes in ESCs and neural progenitors using 5C and super-resolution microscopy. The genomic loci of repressed PcG targets formed discrete, small (20\textendash 140 Kb) domains of tight interaction that corresponded to locations bound by canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). These domains changed during differentiation as PRC1 binding changed. Their formation depended upon the Polyhomeotic component of canonical PRC1 and occurred independently of PRC1-catalyzed ubiquitylation. PRC1 domains differ from topologically associating domains in size and boundary characteristics. These domains have the potential to play a key role in transmitting epigenetic silencing of PcG targets by linking PRC1 to formation of a repressive higher-order structure.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila esc-like gene (escl) encodes a protein very similar to ESC. Like ESC, ESCL binds directly to the E(Z) histone methyltransferase via its WD region. In contrast to ESC, which is present at highest levels during embryogenesis and low levels thereafter, ESCL is continuously present throughout development and in adults. ESC/E(Z) complexes are present at high levels mainly during embryogenesis but ESCL/E(Z) complexes are found throughout development. While depletion of either ESCL or ESC by RNAi in S2 and Kc cells has little effect on E(Z)-mediated methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), simultaneous depletion of ESCL and ESC results in loss of di- and trimethyl-H3K27, indicating that either ESC or ESCL is necessary and sufficient for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 in vivo. While E(Z) complexes in S2 cells contain predominantly ESC, in ESC-depleted S2 cells, ESCL levels rise dramatically and ESCL replaces ESC in E(Z) complexes. A mutation in escl that produces very little protein is viable and exhibits no phenotypes but strongly enhances esc mutant phenotypes, suggesting they have similar functions. esc escl double homozygotes die at the end of the larval period, indicating that the well-known ``maternal rescue'' of esc homozygotes requires ESCL. Furthermore, maternal and zygotic over-expression of escl fully rescues the lethality of esc null mutant embryos that contain no ESC protein, indicating that ESCL can substitute fully for ESC in vivo. These data thus indicate that ESC and ESCL play similar if not identical functions in E(Z) complexes in vivo. Despite this, when esc is expressed normally, escl appears to be entirely dispensable, at least for development into morphologically normal fertile adults. Furthermore, the larval lethality of esc escl double mutants, together with the lack of phenotypes in the escl mutant, further suggests that in wild-type (esc+) animals it is the post-embryonic expression of esc, not escl, that is important for development of normal adults. Thus escl appears to function in a backup capacity during development that becomes important only when normal esc expression is compromised.},

Synthetic restoration of a single transcription factor binding site lost in the snake lineage reinstated full in vivo function to the snake enhancer.

Here, we describe a novel mode of histone crosstalk during gene silencing, in which histone H2A monoubiquitylation is coupled to the removal of histone H3 Lys 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). This pathway was uncovered through the identification of dRING-associated factors (dRAF), a novel Polycomb group (PcG) silencing complex harboring the histone H2A ubiquitin ligase dRING, PSC and the F-box protein, and demethylase dKDM2. In vivo, dKDM2 shares many transcriptional targets with Polycomb and counteracts the histone methyltransferases TRX and ASH1. Importantly, cellular depletion and in vitro reconstitution assays revealed that dKDM2 not only mediates H3K36me2 demethylation but is also required for efficient H2A ubiquitylation by dRING/PSC. Thus, dRAF removes an active mark from histone H3 and adds a repressive one to H2A. These findings reveal coordinate trans-histone regulation by a PcG complex to mediate gene repression.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax Group (trxG) proteins maintain the ``OFF'' and ``ON'' transcriptional states of HOX genes and other targets by modulation of chromatin structure. In Drosophila, PcG proteins are bound to DNA fragments called Polycomb group response elements (PREs). The prevalent model holds that PcG proteins bind PREs only in cells where the target gene is ``OFF''. Another model posits that transcription through PREs disrupts associated PcG complexes, contributing to the establishment of the ``ON'' transcriptional state. We tested these two models at the PcG target gene engrailed. engrailed exists in a gene complex with invected, which together have 4 well-characterized PREs. Our data show that these PREs are not transcribed in embryos or larvae. We also examined whether PcG proteins are bound to an engrailed PRE in cells where engrailed is transcribed. By FLAG-tagging PcG proteins and expressing them specifically where engrailed is ``ON'' or ``OFF'', we determined that components of three major PcG protein complexes are present at an engrailed PRE in both the ``ON'' and ``OFF'' transcriptional states in larval tissues. These results show that PcG binding per se does not determine the transcriptional state of engrailed.},

As part of the mechanisms involved, PREs are thought to mediate this transcriptional memory function by building up higher-order structures in the nucleus. To address this question, we analysed in vivo the three-dimensional structure of the homeotic locus bithorax complex (BX-C) by combining chromosome conformation capture (3C) with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and FISH immunostaining (FISH-I) analysis. We found that, in the repressed state, all major elements that have been shown to bind PcG proteins, including PREs and core promoters, interact at a distance, giving rise to a topologically complex structure. We show that this structure is important for epigenetic silencing of the BX-C, as we find that major changes in higher-order structures must occur to stably maintain alternative transcription states, whereas histone modification and reduced levels of PcG proteins determine an epigenetic switch that is only partially heritable.},

In particular, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) has been implicated in a variety of metabolic events including cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis. 25HC is detectable in human plasma after ingestion of a meal rich in oxysterols and following a dietary cholesterol challenge. In addition, the levels of oxysterols, including 25HC, have been found to be elevated in hypercholesterolemic serum. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we demonstrate that the estrogen receptor (ER) a mediates gene expression changes and growth responses induced by 25HC in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, 25HC exhibits the ERadependent ability like 17b-estradiol (E2) to inhibit the up-regulation of HIF-1a and connective tissue growth factor by hypoxic conditions in cardiomyocytes and rat heart preparations and to prevent the hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Conclusions/Significance: The estrogen action exerted by 25HC may be considered as an additional factor involved in the progression of breast and ovarian tumors. Moreover, the estrogen-like activity of 25HC elicited in the cardiovascular system may play a role against hypoxic environments.},

  abstract = {DNA sequence and inherited gene silencing Cell fate decisions require a gene's transcriptional status, whether on or off, to be stably and heritably maintained over multiple cell generations. For silenced genes, heterochromatin domains are associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications, and these histone marks are maintained during DNA replication and chromosome duplication (see the Perspective by De and Kassis). Laprell et al. show that parental methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) nucleosomes in Drosophila are inherited in daughter cells after replication and can repress transcription, but that they are not sufficient to propagate the mark. Trimethylation of newly incorporated nucleosomes requires recruitment of the methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to neighboring cis-regulatory DNA elements. Coleman and Struhl demonstrate that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting epigenetic memory at a Drosophila HOX gene through anchoring of PRC2 at the Polycomb response element binding site. Wang and Moazed examine fission yeast and show that both sequence-dependent and chromodomain sequence-independent mechanisms are required for stable epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications and the epigenetic maintenance of silencing. These studies highlight the crucial role of DNA binding for heritable gene silencing during growth and development. Science, this issue p. 85, p. eaai8236, p. 88; see also p. 28 Epigenetic inheritance models posit that during Polycomb repression, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) propagates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) independently of DNA sequence. We show that insertion of Polycomb response element (PRE) DNA into the Drosophila genome creates extended domains of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin and causes repression of a linked reporter gene. After excision of PRE DNA, H3K27me3 nucleosomes become diluted with each round of DNA replication, and reporter gene repression is lost. After excision in replication-stalled cells, H3K27me3 levels stay high and repression persists. H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes therefore provide a memory of repression that is transmitted in a sequence-independent manner to daughter strand DNA during replication. In contrast, propagation of H3K27 trimethylation to newly incorporated nucleosomes requires sequence-specific targeting of PRC2 to PRE DNA. The propagation of H3K27 trimethylation at repressed genes requires targeting of PRC2 to cis-acting Polycomb response elements. The propagation of H3K27 trimethylation at repressed genes requires targeting of PRC2 to cis-acting Polycomb response elements.},

  abstract = {Following fertilization, the unified germ cells rapidly transition to a totipotent embryo. Maternally deposited mRNAs encode the proteins necessary for this reprogramming as the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally quiescent during the initial stages of development. The transcription factors required to activate the zygotic genome are among these maternally deposited mRNAs and are robustly translated following fertilization. In Drosophila, the mRNA encoding Zelda, the major activator of the zygotic genome, is not translated until 1 h after fertilization. Here we demonstrate that zelda translation is repressed in the early embryo by the TRIM-NHL protein Brain tumor (BRAT). BRAT also regulates Zelda levels in the larval neuroblast lineage. In the embryo, BRAT-mediated translational repression is regulated by the Pan Gu kinase, which is triggered by egg activation. The Pan Gu kinase phosphorylates translational regulators, suggesting that Pan Gu kinase activity alleviates translational repression of zelda by BRAT and coupling translation of zelda with that of other regulators of early embryonic development. Using the premature translation of zelda in embryos lacking BRAT activity, we showed that early translation of a zygotic genome activator is not sufficient to drive precocious gene expression. Instead, Zelda-target genes showed increased expression at the time they are normally activated. We propose that transition through early development requires the integration of multiple processes, including the slowing of the nuclear division cycle and activation of the zygotic genome. These processes are coordinately controlled by Pan Gu kinase-mediated regulation of translation.},

We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and initiator elements, which were masked at mean expression levels. Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.},

We show that H2A.Z.1(K3R3) is properly incorporated at target promoters in murine ESCs (mESCs), but loss of monoubiquitylation leads to de-repression of bivalent genes, loss of Polycomb binding, and faulty lineage commitment. Using quantitative proteomics, we find that tandem bromodomain proteins, including the BET family member BRD2, are enriched in H2A.Z.1 chromatin. We further show that BRD2 is gained at de-repressed promoters in H2A.Z.1(K3R3) mESCs, whereas BRD2 inhibition restores gene silencing at these sites. Together, our study reveals an antagonistic relationship between H2A.Z.1ub and BRD2 to regulate the transcriptional balance at bivalent genes to enable proper execution of developmental programs.}

PRC2 methylates lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me), while PRC1 mono-ubiquitinates histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2Aub1). Here we present engineered mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) targeting the PRC2 subunits EZH1 and EZH2 to discriminate between contributions of distinct H3K27 methylation states and the presence of PRC2/1 at chromatin. We generate catalytically inactive EZH2 mutant ESCs, demonstrating that H3K27 methylation, but not recruitment to the chromatin, is essential for proper ESC differentiation. We further show that EZH1 activity is sufficient to maintain repression of Polycomb targets by depositing H3K27me2/3 and preserving PRC1 recruitment. This occurs in the presence of altered H3K27me1 deposition at actively transcribed genes and by a diffused hyperacetylation of chromatin that compromises ESC developmental potential. Overall, this work provides insights for the contribution of diffuse chromatin invasion by acetyltransferases in PRC2-dependent loss of developmental control.},

Typically, Polycomb response elements (PRE) that direct PcG repression are located at great distances (10s of kb) from the promoters of PcG-repressed genes, and it is not known how these PREs can communicate with promoters over such distances. Using Class II mouse PRC core complexes (mPCCs) assembled from recombinant subunits, we investigated how PcG complexes might bridge distant chromosomal regions. Like native and recombinant Drosophila Class II complexes, mPCC represses chromatin remodeling and transcription. Interestingly, mPCC bound to one polynucleosome template can recruit a second template from solution and renders it refractory to transcription and chromatin remodeling. A Drosophila PRC core complex (dPCC) also is able to recruit a second template. Posterior sex combs (PSC), a subunit of dPCC, inhibits chromatin remodeling and transcription efficiently but requires assembly with dRING1 to recruit chromatin. Thus, repression and template bridging require different subunits of PcG complexes, suggesting that long-range effects may be mechanistically distinct from repression.},

  abstract = {Proper determination of cell fates depends on epigenetic information that is used to preserve memory of decisions made earlier in development. Post-translational modification of histone residues is thought to be a central means by which epigenetic information is propagated. In particular, modifications of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are strongly correlated with both gene activation and gene repression. H3K27 acetylation is found at sites of active transcription, whereas H3K27 methylation is found at loci silenced by Polycomb group proteins. The histones bearing these modifications are encoded by the replication-dependent H3 genes as well as the replication-independent H3.3 genes. Owing to differential rates of nucleosome turnover, H3K27 acetylation is enriched on replication-independent H3.3 histones at active gene loci, and H3K27 methylation is enriched on replication-dependent H3 histones across silenced gene loci. Previously, we found that modification of replicationdependent H3K27 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing, but it is not required for gene activation. However, the contribution of replication-independent H3.3K27 to these functions is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the endogenous replicationindependent H3.3K27 to a non-modifiable residue. Surprisingly, we find that H3.3K27 is also required for Polycomb target gene silencing despite the association of H3.3 with active transcription. However, the requirement for H3.3K27 comes at a later stage of development than that found for replication-dependent H3K27, suggesting a greater reliance on replication-independent H3.3K27 in post-mitotic cells. Notably, we find no evidence of global transcriptional defects in H3.3K27 mutants, despite the strong correlation between H3.3K27 acetylation and active transcription.},

  abstract = {During the regeneration of Drosophila imaginal discs, cellular identities can switch fate in a process known as transdetermination1. For leg-to-wing transdetermination, the underlying mechanism involves morphogens such as Wingless that, when activated outside their normal context, induce ectopic expression of the wing-specific selector gene vestigial2,3. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain cellular fates by controlling the expression patterns of homeotic genes and other developmental regulators4. Here we report that transdetermination events are coupled to PcG regulation. We show that the frequency of transdetermination is enhanced in PcG mutant flies. Downregulation of PcG function, as monitored by the reactivation of a silent PcG-regulated reporter gene, is observed in transdetermined cells. This downregulation is directly controlled by theJun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway, which is activated in cells undergoing regeneration. Accordingly, transdetermination frequency is reduced in a JNK mutant background. This regulatory interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, indicating that the role of this signalling cascade in remodelling cellular fates may be conserved.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) complexes PRC1 and PRC2 are well known for silencing specific developmental genes. PRC2 is a methyltransferase targeting histone H3K27 and producing H3K27me3, essential for stable silencing. Less well known but quantitatively much more important is the genome-wide role of PRC2 that dimethylates {$\sim$}70\% of total H3K27. We show that H3K27me2 occurs in inverse proportion to transcriptional activity in most non-PcG target genes and intergenic regions and is governed by opposing roaming activities of PRC2 and complexes containing the H3K27 demethylase UTX. Surprisingly, loss of H3K27me2 results in global transcriptional derepression proportionally greatest in silent or weakly transcribed intergenic and genic regions and accompanied by an increase of H3K27ac and H3K4me1. H3K27me2 therefore sets a threshold that prevents random, unscheduled transcription all over the genome and even limits the activity of highly transcribed genes. PRC1-type complexes also have global roles. Unexpectedly, we find a pervasive distribution of histone H2A ubiquitylated at lysine 118 (H2AK118ub) outside of canonical PcG target regions, dependent on the RING/Sce subunit of PRC1-type complexes. We show, however, that H2AK118ub does not mediate the global PRC2 activity or the global repression and is predominantly produced by a new complex involving L(3)73Ah, a homolog of mammalian PCGF3.},

  title = {Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms Underlying the Regulation of Flowering Time},
  author = {{Lejon Kralemann}},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Developmental transitions and responses to the environment have a tight epigenetic control. Especially the switch to flowering is important for plants because it allows (sexual) reproduction, and should not occur unless the conditions are right. External and internal signals are relayed via FT/TFL1 genes; genes with a great impact on flowering time. The PRC1/PRC2 system plays an important role in the repression of flowering, indicated by the aberrant flowering phenotype of its mutants. Via deposition of histone modifications H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 it keeps genes stably silenced, so that transitions and responses do not happen as a result of random fluctuations in the internal or external environment.  In the first manuscript we focussed on PRC2-component MSI1 in Arabidopsis. MSI1 is the nucleosome-binding core component of PRC2 and other chromatin-modifying complexes. We found that MSI1 is also a core part of a histone de-acetylase complex together with histone de-acetylase HDA19. We further found that this complex represses the ABA-mediated salt stress response by de-acetylating the ABA receptors. The second manuscript focused on flowering time in the invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia. During the last couple of centuries it invaded Europe, where it currently thrives mostly in the south-east. Earlier flowering populations have since been found in the north, suggesting local adaptation. We studied this early-flowering trait and found that it is inherited dominantly, and that it is maladaptive under long vegetation periods. We also identified the FT/TFL1 genes in this species, and found that a combination of expression changes in the FT-like floral activator and TFL1-like floral repressor likely underlies the altered flowering time. In the third manuscript we tried to shed light on repressive H2A de-ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Previously, it has been observed that loss of UBP12/13-mediated H2A deubiquitination causes loss of H3K27me3 and re-activation of some PRC2 targets. We show now that this holds true on a genome-wide level, and that the genes targeted by UBP12/13 are those affected in H3K27me3 maintenance and expression. We also showed that H2Aub1 not only recruits PRC2, but likely also recruits H3K27 demethylase REF6. We show that H2Aub1 therefore puts genes in a state responsive to stimuli, and that stable repression requires its removal.}

In this review, we break down several critical steps, emphasizing new data and techniques that have expanded current gene regulatory models. We begin at the level of DNA sequence where cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) provide important regulatory information in the form of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this respect, CRMs function as instructional platforms for the assembly of gene regulatory complexes. We discuss multiple mechanisms controlling complex assembly, including cooperative DNA binding, combinatorial codes, and CRM architecture. The second section of this review places CRM assembly in the context of nucleosomes and condensed chromatin. We discuss how DNA accessibility and histone modifications contribute to TF function. Lastly, new advances in chromosomal mapping techniques have provided increased understanding of intra- and interchromosomal interactions. We discuss how these topological maps influence gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in Drosophila. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping in vivo based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications., Organisms have tens of thousands of genes, but finding out exactly what they all do is one of the greatest challenges of modern genetics. To understand a gene's job, it's necessary to find out what gene is active in which tissue, where their proteins are located within the cell, and what happens when the sequence of a gene is altered or removed. This multi-step process of `annotating' genes can be challenging in practice., One common approach is to make use of a DNA pattern called a MiMIC and insert it in a specific part of the gene called an intron. A tag for a protein that glows green under the microscope can then be added to a MiMIC to help visualize where and when the protein is being expressed. MiMICs can also be used to integrate a system called T2A-GAL4, which typically creates a severe mutation in the gene and allows to track the timing of when and where the gene is expressed. This helps to discover the role of the gene in cells and tissues. However, a problem with this approach is that when either the protein tag or the T2A-GAL4 system is added, half of the time they point into the wrong direction. This is because each DNA strand is read in one direction only., Now, Li-Kroeger et al. created a so-called `Double Header' system, which includes T2A-GAL4 coding in one direction and the protein tag in the other. Therefore, when the system integrates, there will always be one tag pointing in the correct direction. This makes the system twice as efficient., Not all genes have introns though. To access genes that do not contain introns, Li-Kroeger et al. developed another system, which uses the genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a different kind of visible marker. Here, the whole gene is typically removed and replaced by a visible marker, which can then be replaced by any DNA, including protein tags and the T2A-GAL4 system., With these approaches, all genes in the fruit fly can now be targeted. The systems perform several tasks, including detecting gene activity and the location of proteins in the cell, and analyzing the role of the protein. The findings will be relevant to researchers interested in fruit fly genetics and cell function.},

Two negatively charged amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of cI play a key role in activation, suggesting that these residues contact RNA polymerase. The subunit of RNA polymerase involved was identified by selecting polymerase mutants that restored the activation function of a mutant form of cI protein. Although previous studies suggest that several activators interact with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, the results here suggest that cI interacts with the sigma subunit. An arginine to histidine change near the carboxyl terminus of sigma specifically suppresses an aspartic acid to asparagine change in the activation region of cI. This finding supports the direct-contact model and suggests that a cluster of positively charged residues near the carboxyl terminus of sigma is the target of the negatively charged activation region of cI.},

At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12, but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown to be bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda, suggesting that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences.},

Once the cell fates are determined, Polycomb-group proteins frequently maintain the repressed state of the genes. This study investigates how Polycomb-group proteins repress the expression of tailless, which encodes a developmental regulator in Drosophila embryo. Previous studies have shown that maternal Tramtrack69 facilitates maternal GAGA-binding factor and Heat shock factor binding to the torso response element (tor-RE) to initiate tailless repression in the stage-4 embryo. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation and genetic-interaction studies exhibit that maternally-deposited Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) recruited by the tor-RE-associated Tramtrack69 represses tailless expression in the stage-4 embryo. A noncanonical Polycomb-group response element (PRE) is mapped to the tailless proximal region. High levels of Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad (BTB)-domain proteins are fundamental for maintaining tailless repression in the stage-8 to -10 embryos. Trmtrack69 sporadically distributes in the linear BTB-domain oligomer, which recruits and retains a high level of PRC1 near the GCCAT cluster for repressing tll expression in the stage-14 embryos. Disrupting the retention of PRC1 decreases the levels of PRC1 and Pleiohomeotic protein substantially on the PRE and causes tailless derepression in the stage-14 embryo. Furthermore, the retained PRC1 potentially serves as a second foundation for assembling the well-characterized polymer of the Sterile alpha motif domain in Polyhomeotic protein, which compacts chromatin to maintain the repressed state of tailless in the embryos after stage 14.},

  abstract = {A number of approaches for Cas9-mediated transcriptional activation have recently been developed, allowing target genes to be overexpressed from their endogenous genomic loci. However, these approaches have thus far been limited to cell culture, and this technique has not been demonstrated in vivo in any animal. The technique involving the fewest separate components, and therefore the most amenable to in vivo applications, is the dCas9-VPR system, where a nuclease-dead Cas9 is fused to a highly active chimeric activator domain. In this study, we characterize the dCas9-VPR system in Drosophila cells and in vivo. We show that this system can be used in cell culture to upregulate a range of target genes, singly and in multiplex, and that a single guide RNA upstream of the transcription start site can activate high levels of target transcription. We observe marked heterogeneity in guide RNA efficacy for any given gene, and we confirm that transcription is inhibited by guide RNAs binding downstream of the transcription start site. To demonstrate one application of this technique in cells, we used dCas9-VPR to identify target genes for Twist and Snail, two highly conserved transcription factors that cooperate during Drosophila mesoderm development. In addition, we simultaneously activated both Twist and Snail to identify synergistic responses to this physiologically relevant combination. Finally, we show that dCas9-VPR can activate target genes and cause dominant phenotypes in vivo, providing the first demonstration of dCas9 activation in a multicellular animal. Transcriptional activation using dCas9-VPR thus offers a simple and broadly applicable technique for a variety of overexpression studies.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that control transcription is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment. Using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we directly sequenced the cytosine methylome (methylC-seq), transcriptome (mRNA-seq), and small RNA transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to generate highly integrated epigenome maps for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase or demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.},

  abstract = {The accessibility of target gene, a factor critical for gene regulation, is controlled by epigenetic fine-tuning of chromatin organization. While there are multiple experimental techniques to study change of chromatin architecture with its epigenetic state, measurements from them are not always complementary. A qualitative discrepancy is noted between recent super-resolution imaging studies, particularly on Polycomb-group protein repressed domains in Drosophila cell. One of the studies shows that Polycomb-repressed domains are more compact than inactive domains and are segregated from neighboring active domains, whereas Hi-C and chromatin accessibility assay as well as the other super-resolution imaging studies paint a different picture. To examine this issue in detail, we analyzed Hi-C libraries of Drosophila chromosomes as well as distance constraints from one of the imaging studies, and modeled different epigenetic domains by employing a polymer-based approach. According to our chromosome models, both Polycomb-repressed and inactive domains are featured with a similar degree of intra-domain packaging and significant intermixing with adjacent active domains. The epigenetic domains explicitly visualized by our polymer model call for extra attention to the discrepancy of the super-resolution imaging with other measurements, although its precise physicochemical origin still remains to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the technologies we have developed to control proteins with light. First, we focus on the LOV domain, a versatile building block with reversible photo-response, kinetics tunable through mutagenesis, and ready expression in a broad range of cells and animals. Incorporation of LOV into proteins produced a variety of approaches: simple steric block of the active site released when irradiation lengthened a linker (PA-GTPases), reversible release from sequestration at mitochondria (LOVTRAP), and Z-lock, a method in which a light-cleavable bridge is placed where it occludes the active site. The latter two methods make use of Zdk, small engineered proteins that bind selectively to the dark state of LOV. In order to control endogenous proteins, inhibitory peptides are embedded in the LOV domain where they are exposed only upon irradiation (PKA and MLCK inhibition). Similarly, controlled exposure of a nuclear localization sequence and nuclear export sequence is used to reversibly send proteins into the nucleus. Another avenue of engineering makes use of the heterodimerization of FKBP and FRB proteins, induced by the small molecule rapamycin. We control rapamycin with light or simply add it to target cells. Incorporation of fused FKBP-FRB into kinases, guanine exchange factors, or GTPases leads to rapamycininduced protein activation. Kinases are engineered so that they can interact with only a specific substrate upon activation. Recombination of split proteins using rapamycin-induced conformational changes minimizes spontaneous reassembly. Finally, we explore the insertion of LOV or rapamycin-responsive domains into proteins such that light-induced conformational changes exert allosteric control of the active site. We hope these design ideas will inspire new applications and broaden our reach towards dynamic biological processes that unfold when studied in vivo.},

Surprisingly, whether Ubx functions as an activator or repressor differs depending on the proximal-distal position in the segment and the availability of Hox cofactors.

The HP1 family is evolutionarily conserved, with members in fungi, plants and animals but not prokaryotes, and there are multiple members within the same species. The amino-terminal chromodomain binds methylated lysine 9 of histone H3, causing transcriptional repression. The highly conserved carboxy-terminal chromoshadow domain enables dimerization and also serves as a docking site for proteins involved in a wide variety of nuclear functions, from transcription to nuclear architecture. In addition to heterochromatin packaging, it is becoming increasingly clear that HP1 proteins have diverse roles in the nucleus, including the regulation of euchromatic genes. HP1 proteins are amenable to posttranslational modifications that probably regulate these distinct functions, thereby creating a subcode within the context of the 'histone code' of histone posttranslational modifications.},

Genome-wide nucleosome assembly on paternal DNA implies the replacement of sperm chromosomal proteins, such as protamines, by maternally provided histones1,2. This fundamental process is specifically impaired in s\'esame (ssm), a unique Drosophila maternal effect mutant that prevents male pronucleus formation3. Here we show that ssm is a point mutation in the Hira gene, thus demonstrating that the histone chaperone protein HIRA is required for nucleosome assembly during sperm nucleus decondensation. In vertebrates, HIRA has recently been shown to be critical for a nucleosome assembly pathway independent of DNA synthesis that specifically involves the H3.3 histone variant4,5. We also show that nucleosomes containing H3.3, and not H3, are specifically assembled in paternal Drosophila chromatin before the first round of DNA replication. The exclusive marking of paternal chromosomes with H3.3 represents a primary epigenetic distinction between parental genomes in the zygote, and underlines an important consequence of the critical and highly specialized function of HIRA at fertilization.},

The deposition of replicative H3 variant following DNA replication is essential for the transmission of the epigenomic information encoded in posttranscriptional modifications. Through this process, replicative H3 maintains cell fate while, in contrast, the replacement H3.3 variant opposes cell differentiation during early embryogenesis. In later steps of development, H3.3 and specialized H3 variants are emerging as new, important regulators of terminal cell differentiation, including neurons and gametes. The specific pathways that regulate the dynamics of the deposition of H3.3 are paramount during reprogramming events that drive zygotic activation and the initiation of a new cycle of development.},

BAP1 mutations are also observed at low frequency in other malignancies including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and bladder cancers. BAP1 germline mutations are associated with high incidence of mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and other cancers, defining the "BAP1 cancer syndrome." Interestingly, germline BAP1 mutations constitute an important paradigm for gene-environment interactions, as loss of BAP1 predisposes to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. Inactivating mutations of BAP1 are also identified in sporadic cancers, denoting the importance of this gene for normal tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression, although some oncogenic properties have also been attributed to BAP1. BAP1 belongs to the deubiquitinase superfamily of enzymes, which are responsible for the maturation and turnover of ubiquitin as well as the reversal of substrate ubiquitination, thus regulating ubiquitin signaling. BAP1 is predominantly nuclear and interacts with several chromatin-associated factors, assembling multi-protein complexes with mutually exclusive partners. BAP1 exerts its function through highly regulated deubiquitination of its substrates. As such, BAP1 orchestrates chromatin-associated processes including gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair. BAP1 also exerts cytoplasmic functions, notably in regulating Ca2+ signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum. This DUB is also subjected to multiple post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation and ubiquitination, indicating that several signaling pathways tightly regulate its function. Recent progress indicated that BAP1 plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell metabolism, as well as cell survival and death. In this review, we summarize the biological and molecular functions of BAP1 and explain how the inactivation of this DUB might cause human cancers. We also highlight some of the unresolved questions and suggest potential new directions.}

Our data describe landscapes of long-lived proteins in somatic and reproductive tissues of Drosophila during adult lifespan, and reveal a preferential ubiquitylation of older long-lived proteins. We identify an age-modulated increase of ubiquitylation on long-lived histone 2A protein in Drosophila, which is evolutionarily conserved in mouse, monkey, and human. A reduction of ubiquitylated histone 2A in mutant flies is associated with longevity and healthy lifespan. Together, our data reveal an evolutionarily conserved biomarker of aging that links epigenetic modulation of the long-lived histone protein to lifespan.}

In the Drosophila genome, these proteins bind to DNA regions called Polycomb response elements (PREs). A major role in the recruitment of PcG proteins to PREs is played by DNA-binding factors, several of which have been characterized in detail. However, current knowledge is insufficient for comprehensively describing the mechanism of this process.

The processes that govern specification of cell identity occur mostly in the absence of modifications of DNA sequence and are thus termed ``epigenetic.'' Once established, defined cellular states have to be perpetuated from mother to daughter cell. Pioneering studies in prokaryotes and then in eukaryotes led to the identification of regulatory proteins termed transcription factors whose function is to modulate gene expression through direct binding of specific DNA sequences. Subsequent work identified a distinct class of regulatory proteins that act at the level of chromatin through covalent modification of histones, chromatin compaction, or nucleosome remodeling. Two such groups of chromatin modifiers, termed Trithorax and Polycomb, are essential for maintaining active (Trithorax) and repressed (Polycomb) expression states of a number of developmental regulators. Importantly, these functions are conserved in multicellular organisms, from metazoans to plants. In this chapter, we will explore the functions of Polycomb and Trithorax proteins during development. We will first emphasize evidence supporting their specific function in regulating maintenance of cellular identity in diverse organisms. We will then examine the molecular mechanisms through which Polycomb and Trithorax proteins function to fine-tune developmental programs.}

  abstract = {During terminal differentiation, most cells exit the cell cycle and enter into a prolonged or permanent G0 in which they are refractory to mitogenic signals. Entry into G0 is usually initiated through the repression of cell cycle gene expression by formation of a transcriptional repressor complex called dimerization partner (DP), retinoblastoma (RB)-like, E2F and MuvB (DREAM). However, when DREAM repressive function is compromised during terminal differentiation, additional unknown mechanisms act to stably repress cycling and ensure robust cell cycle exit. Here, we provide evidence that developmentally programmed, temporal changes in chromatin accessibility at a small subset of critical cell cycle genes act to enforce cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation in the Drosophila melanogaster wing. We show that during terminal differentiation, chromatin closes at a set of pupal wing enhancers for the key rate-limiting cell cycle regulators Cyclin E (cycE), E2F transcription factor 1 (e2f1), and string (stg). This closing coincides with wing cells entering a robust postmitotic state that is strongly refractory to cell cycle reactivation, and the regions that close contain known binding sites for effectors of mitogenic signaling pathways such as Yorkie and Notch. When cell cycle exit is genetically disrupted, chromatin accessibility at cell cycle genes remains unaffected, and the closing of distal enhancers at cycE, e2f1, and stg proceeds independent of the cell cycling status. Instead, disruption of cell cycle exit leads to changes in accessibility and expression of a subset of hormone-induced transcription factors involved in the progression of terminal differentiation. Our results uncover a mechanism that acts as a cell cycle\textendash independent timer to limit the response to mitogenic signaling and aberrant cycling in terminally differentiating tissues. In addition, we provide a new molecular description of the cross talk between cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation during metamorphosis.},

Here, we outline historical and current thinking regarding the functions of histone modifications and their associated enzymes. One current viewpoint, based largely on correlative evidence, posits that histone modifications are instructive for transcriptional regulation and represent an epigenetic 'code'. Recent studies have challenged this model and suggest that histone marks previously associated with active genes do not directly cause transcriptional activation. Additionally, many histone-modifying proteins possess non-catalytic functions that overshadow their enzymatic activities. Given that much remains unknown regarding the functions of these proteins, the field should be cautious in interpreting loss-of-function phenotypes and must consider both cellular and developmental context. In this Perspective, we focus on recent progress relating to the catalytic and non-catalytic functions of the Trithorax-COMPASS complexes, Polycomb repressive complexes and Clr4/Suv39 histone-modifying machineries.}

Here, we identified the PWWP-DOMAIN INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS1 (PWO1) protein which interacts with all three Arabidopsis PRC2 histone methyltransferases and is required for keeping full H3 occupancy at several Arabidopsis genes. PWO1 localizes and recruits CLF to nuclear speckles in tobacco nuclei, suggesting a role in spatial organization of PcG regulation. PWO1 belongs to a gene family with three members acting redundantly: pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutants are seedling lethal and show shoot and root meristem arrest, while pwo1 single mutants are early flowering. Interestingly, PWWP domain of PWO1 confers binding to histones, which is reduced by a point mutation in a highly conserved residue of this domain and blocked by phosphorylation of H3S28. PWO1 carrying this mutation is not able to fully complement the pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutant, indicating the requirement of this domain for PWO1 in vivo activity. Thus, the PWO family may present a novel class of histone readers which are involved in recruiting PcG proteins to subnuclear domains and in promoting Arabidopsis development.}

  abstract = {We report here experiments aimed at understanding the connections between cell competition and growth in the Drosophila wing disc. The principal assay has been to generate discs containing marked cells that proliferate at different rates and to study their interactions and their contribution to the final structure. It is known that single clones of fast-dividing cells within a compartment may occupy the larger part of the compartment without affecting its size. This has suggested the existence of interactions involving cell competition between fast- and slow-dividing cells directed to accommodate the contribution of each cell to the final compartment. Here we show that indeed fast-dividing cells can outcompete slow-dividing ones in their proximity. However, we argue that this elimination is of little consequence because preventing apoptosis, and therefore cell competition, in those compartments does not affect the size of the clones or the size of the compartments. Our experiments indicate that cells within a compartment proliferate autonomously at their own rate. The contribution of each cell to the compartment is exclusively determined by its division rate within the frame of a size control mechanism that stops growth once the compartment has reached the final arresting size. This is supported by a computer simulation of the contribution of individual fast clones growing within a population of slower dividing cells and without interacting with them. The values predicted by the simulation are very close to those obtained experimentally.},

  abstract = {Proper determination of cell fates depends on epigenetic information that is used to preserve memory of decisions made earlier in development. Post-translational modification of histone residues is thought to be a central means by which epigenetic information is propagated. In particular, modifications of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are strongly correlated with both gene activation and gene repression. H3K27 acetylation is found at sites of active transcription, whereas H3K27 methylation is found at loci silenced by Polycomb group proteins. The histones bearing these modifications are encoded by the replication-dependent H3 genes as well as the replication-independent H3.3 genes. Owing to differential rates of nucleosome turnover, H3K27 acetylation is enriched on replication-independent H3.3 histones at active gene loci, and H3K27 methylation is enriched on replication-dependent H3 histones across silenced gene loci. Previously, we found that modification of replication-dependent H3K27 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing, but it is not required for gene activation. However, the contribution of replication-independent H3.3K27 to these functions is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the endogenous replication-independent H3.3K27 to a non-modifiable residue. Surprisingly, we find that H3.3K27 is also required for Polycomb target gene silencing despite the association of H3.3 with active transcription. However, the requirement for H3.3K27 comes at a later stage of development than that found for replication-dependent H3K27, suggesting a greater reliance on replication-independent H3.3K27 in post-mitotic cells. Notably, we find no evidence of global transcriptional defects in H3.3K27 mutants, despite the strong correlation between H3.3K27 acetylation and active transcription.}

We previously identified winged eye (wge) as a factor that induces eye-to-wing TD upon overexpression in eye imaginal discs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying TD have remained largely unclear. Here, we found that wge induces various histone modifications and enhances the methylation of Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a feature of heterochromatin. A histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9, is required for wge-mediated H3K9 methylation and eye-towing TD. Su(var)3-9 is also required for classical wound-induced TD but not for normal development, suggesting its involvement in several types of imaginal disc TDs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that wge represses eye identity genes independently of Su(var)3-9 and activates TD-related genes by acting together with Su(var)3-9. These findings provide new insights into diverse types of chromatin regulation at progressive steps of cell-fate conversions.},

We have previously shown that ectopic expression of wingless (wg) induces leg disc cells to activate expression of the wing marker Vestigial (Vg) and transdetermine to wing cells. Here we show that ectopic wg expression non-cell-autonomously induces Vg expression in leg discs and that activated Armadillo, a cytosolic transducer of the Wg signal, cell-autonomously induces Vg expression in leg discs, indicating that this Vg expression is directly activated by Wg signaling. We find that ubiquitous expression of wg in leg discs can induce only dorsal leg disc cells to express Vg and transdetermine to wing. Dorsal leg disc cells normally express high levels of decapentaplegic (dpp) and its downstream target, optomotor-blind (omb). We find that high levels of dpp expression, which are both necessary and sufficient for dorsal leg development, are required for wg-induced transdetermination. We show that dorsalization of ventral leg disc cells, through targeted expression of either dpp or omb, is sufficient to allow wg to induce Vg expression and wing fate. Thus, dpp and omb promote both dorsal leg cell fate as well as transdetermination-competent leg disc cells. Taken together, our results show that the Wg and Dpp signaling pathways cooperate to induce Vg expression and leg-towing transdetermination. We also show that a specific vg regulatory element, the vg boundary enhancer, is required for transdetermination. We propose that an interaction between Wg and Dpp signaling can explain why leg disc cells transdetermine to wing and that our results have implications for normal leg and wing development.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such ``genetically coupled'' link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Drosophila imaginal discs, the primordia of the adult fly appendages, are an excellent system for studying developmental plasticity. Cells in the imaginal discs are determined for their disc-specific fate (wingness, legness) during embryogenesis. Disc cells maintain their determination during larval development, a time of extensive growth and proliferation. Only when prompted to regenerate do disc cells exhibit lability in their determined identity. Regeneration in the disc is mediated by a localized region of cell division, known as the regeneration blastema. Most regenerating disc cells strictly adhere to their disc-specific identity; some cells however, switch fate in a phenomenon known as transdetermination. Similar regeneration and transdetermination events can be induced in situ by misexpression of the signaling molecule wingless. Recent studies indicate that the plasticity of disc cells during regeneration is associated with high morphogen activity and the reorganization of chromatin structure. Here we provide both a historical perspective of imaginal disc transdetermination, as well as discuss recent findings on how imaginal disc cells acquire developmental plasticity and multipotency. We also highlight how an understanding of imaginal disc transdetermination can enhance an understanding of developmental potency exhibited by stem cells.},

Thus the functional homology between these developmental controlling genes is reflected in a structural homology in their gene products. The homeo box sequence is also present in a few copies in the genomes of some other invertebrates, and is even conserved in vertebrate genomes, including the human genome.

Here, we use genome-wide open chromatin profiling to show that among the Drosophila appendages, the same DNA regulatory modules are accessible throughout the genome at a given stage of development, except at the loci encoding the master regulators themselves. In addition, open chromatin profiles change over developmental time, and these changes are coordinated between different appendages.

CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a compaction region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional compaction region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations.

Both proteins act by changing the structure and activity of a broad spectrum of target proteins, typically by modifying redox status. Trx and Grx are members of families with multiple and partially redundant genes. The number of genes clearly increased with the appearance of multicellular organisms, in part because of new types of Trx and Grx with orthologs throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. The function of Trx and Grx also broadened as cells achieved increased complexity, especially in the regulation arena. In view of these progressive changes, the ubiquitous distribution of Trx and the wide occurrence of Grx enable these proteins to serve as indicators of the evolutionary history of redox regulation. In so doing, they add a unifying element that links the diverse forms of life to one another in an uninterrupted continuum. It is anticipated that future research will embellish this continuum and further elucidate the properties of these proteins and their impact on biology. The new information will be important not only to our understanding of the role of Trx and Grx in fundamental cell processes but also to future societal benefits as the proteins find new applications in a range of fields.},

They are recruited to Polycomb response elements (PREs) and establish silenced domains over several kilobases. Recent studies show that PRC1 is also directly recruited to active genes by the cohesin complex. Cohesin participates broadly in control of gene transcription, but it is unknown whether cohesin-recruited PRC1 also plays a role in transcriptional control of active genes. We address this question using genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The results show that PRC1 influences transcription of active genes, and a significant fraction of its effects are likely direct. The roles of different PRC1 subunits can also vary depending on the gene. Depletion of PRC1 subunits by RNA interference alters phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and occupancy by the Spt5 pausing-elongation factor at most active genes. These effects on Pol II phosphorylation and Spt5 are likely linked to changes in elongation and RNA processing detected by nascent RNA-seq, although the mechanisms remain unresolved. The experiments also reveal that PRC1 facilitates association of Spt5 with enhancers and PREs. Reduced Spt5 levels at these regulatory sequences upon PRC1 depletion coincide with changes in Pol II occupancy and phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that, in addition to its repressive roles in epigenetic gene silencing, PRC1 broadly influences transcription of active genes and may suppress transcription of nonpromoter regulatory sequences.}

A broad variety of alterations can impair PRC2 activity; yet, overall, only one type of alteration is found in a given class of tumor. We discuss the potential impact of the various types of PRC2 alterations on gene expression. We propose that the distinct set of genes regulated by PRC2, depending on tumor etiology, constrain the type of alteration of PRC2 that can fuel tumor development. Beyond this specificity, we propose that PRC2 and, more generally, chromatin regulators act as gatekeepers of transcriptional integrity, a role that often confers a tumor-suppressive function.}

Established conceptions about their activities, mostly derived from work in embryonic stem cells, are being modified by new findings in differentiated cells.

Recent work has unveiled an association of Polycomb components with transcriptionally active loci and the promotion of gene expression, in clear contrast with conventional recognition as repressors. Focusing on mammalian models, I review here advances concerning roles in transcriptional control.

This understanding has been bolstered in the past decade by the identification of new types of histone PTM, the advent of new genome-wide mapping approaches and methods to deposit or remove PTMs in a locally and temporally controlled manner. Now, with the availability of vast amounts of data across various biological systems, the functional role of PTMs in important processes (such as transcription, recombination, replication, DNA repair and the modulation of genomic architecture) is slowly emerging. This Review explores the contribution of histone PTMs to the regulation of genome function by discussing when these modifications play a causative (or instructive) role in DNA-templated processes and when they are deposited as a consequence of such processes, to reinforce and record the event. Important advances in the field showing that histone PTMs can exert both direct and indirect effects on genome function are also presented.},

PCGF5 loss-of-function impairs the reduction of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 around neural specific genes and keeps them repressed. Our results suggest that PCGF5 might function as both a repressor for SMAD2/TGF-{$\beta$} signaling pathway and a facilitator for neural differentiation. Together, our findings reveal a critical context-specific function for PCGF5 in directing PRC1 to control cell fate.}

  abstract = {The stable maintenance of expression patterns of homeotic genes depends on the function of a number of negative trans-regulators, termed the Polycomb (Pc) group of genes. We have examined the pattern of expression of the Drosophila segment polarity gene, engrailed (en), in embryos mutant for several different members of the Pc group. Here we report that embryos mutant for two or more Pc group genes show strong ectopic en expression, while only weak derepression of en occurs in embryos mutant for a single Pc group gene. This derepression is independent of two known activators of en expression: en itself and wingless. Additionally, in contrast to the strong ectopic expression of homeotic genes observed in extra sex combs- (esc-) mutant embryos, the en expression pattern is nearly normal in esc- embryos. This suggests that the esc gene product functions in a pathway independent of the other genes in the group. The data indicate that the same group of genes is required for stable restriction of en expression to a striped pattern and for the restriction of expression of homeotic genes along the anterior-posterior axis, and support a global role for the Pc group genes in stable repression of activity of developmental selector genes.},

  abstract = {Drosophila appendages (legs, antennae, mouthparts, analia, wings and halteres) arise from imaginal discs in specific segments. The critical event that permits embryonic cells to develop into the appendage primordia is expression of a homeobox gene called Distal-less ( Dll). All imaginal discs subdivide into anterior and posterior compartments. The wing also subdivides into dorsal and ventral compartments in later stages in development. Cells at compartment borders produce morphogens \textemdash{} secreted signalling molecules such as hedgehog (Hh), wingless (Wg) and decapentaplegic (Dpp) \textemdash{} that pattern appendages by forming gradients. Cells respond to these morphogens by activating different patterns of gene expression, depending on the level of morphogen. Trunk cells become separated from appendage cells by mutual antagonism between Hh/Wg/Dpp at the centre of the disc, and the homeobox genes homothorax (hth) and extradenticle ( exd), at the periphery. The response to the gradient of Wg and Dpp signals generates distinct genetic domains along the proximodistal axis of the appendage: high Wg and Dpp levels in the centre of the disc (which becomes the distal appendage) activate Dll, whereas moderate levels in the intermediate zone (which becomes the more proximal appendage) activate  dachshund (dac). Appendage identity is specified by a combination of homeobox gene expression, which specifies the segment, and Dpp or Wg response genes, which specify dorsal or ventral properties. The mechanisms used in Drosophila to segregate the cells fated to form appendages and the genes involved are conserved in vertebrates.},

The transgressing cells are genetically reprogrammed and acquire a new identity, a process facilitated by up regulation of the JNK pathway and transient loss of epigenetic control by the Pc-G and trx-G genes.

  abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) refers to the coordination of global organ axes and individual cell polarity in vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia. Mechanisms of PCP have been best studied in the Drosophila wing, in which each epidermal cell produces a single wing hair at the distal cell edge, and this spatial specification is mediated by redistribution of the core group proteins, including the seven-pass transmembrane cadherin Flamingo/Starry night (Fmi/Stan), to selective plasma membrane domains. Through genetic screening, we found that a mutation of the SMC3 gene caused dramatic misspecification of wing hair positions. SMC3 protein is one subunit of the cohesin complex, which regulates sister chromatid cohesion and also plays a role in transcriptional control of gene expression. In the SMC3 mutant cells, Fmi appeared to be upregulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism(s), and this elevation of Fmi was at least one cause of the PCP defect. In addition to the PCP phenotype, the loss of the cohesin function affected wing morphogenesis at multiple levels: one malformation was loss of the wing margin, and this was most likely a result of downregulation of the homeodomain protein Cut. At the cellular level, apical cell size and hexagonal packing were affected in the mutant wing. Dysfunction of cohesin in humans results in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which is characterized by various developmental abnormalities and mental retardation. Our analysis of cohesin in epithelia may provide new insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms of CdLS.},

Using reversible tethering of PcG proteins to ectopic sites in mouse embryonic stem cells, here we show that PRC1 can trigger transcriptional repression and Polycomb-dependent chromatin modifications. We find that canonical PRC1 (cPRC1), but not variant PRC1, maintains gene silencing through cell division upon reversal of tethering. Propagation of gene repression is sustained by cis-acting histone modifications, PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 and cPRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1, promoting a sequence-independent feedback mechanism for PcG protein recruitment. Thus, the distinct PRC1 complexes present in vertebrates can differentially regulate epigenetic maintenance of gene silencing, potentially enabling dynamic heritable responses to complex stimuli. Our findings reveal how PcG repression is potentially inherited in vertebrates.},

We screened for lncRNAs, which co-precipitate with PRC1 from chromatin and found candidates that impact polycomb group protein (PcG)-regulated gene expression in vivo. A novel lncRNA from this screen, CAT7, regulates expression and polycomb group binding at the MNX1 locus during early neuronal differentiation. CAT7 contains a unique tandem repeat domain that shares high sequence similarity to a non-syntenic zebrafish analog, cat7l. Defects caused by interference of cat7l RNA during zebrafish embryogenesis were rescued by human CAT7 RNA, enhanced by interference of a PRC1 component, and suppressed by interference of a known PRC1 target gene, demonstrating cat7l genetically interacts with a PRC1. We propose a model whereby PRC1 acts in concert with specific lncRNAs and that CAT7/cat7l represents convergent lncRNAs that independently evolved to tune PRC1 repression at individual loci.}

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are conserved regulatory proteins that repress transcription of particular target genes in animals and plants. Studies over the past decade have established that most PcG proteins are not classic DNA binding factors but that they exist in multisubunit protein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin. Nevertheless, PcG repression of target genes in Drosophila requires specific cis-regulatory sequences, called Polycomb response elements (PREs), and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that, in vivo, most PcG proteins are specifically bound at the PREs of target genes. However, the mechanisms by which these PcG protein complexes are recruited to PREs and how they repress transcription are still poorly understood. Recent studies challenge earlier models that invoke covalent histone modifications and chromatin binding as the key steps in the recruitment of PcG proteins to PREs. The available evidence suggests that PREs are largely devoid of nucleosomes and that PRE DNA serves as an assembly platform for many different PcG protein complexes through DNA\textendash protein and protein\textendash protein interactions. The emerging picture suggests that the binding and modification of chromatin by PcG proteins is needed for interaction of PRE-tethered PcG protein complexes with nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin in order to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state at promoters and coding regions of target genes.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate higher-order genome folding and play a critical role in silencing transcription during development. It is commonly proposed that PcG dependent changes in genome folding, which compact chromatin, contribute directly to repression by blocking binding of activating complexes and demixing repressed targets from non-repressed chromatin. To test this model we utilized Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) to trace the 3-dimensional folding of the Hoxa gene cluster, a canonical Polycomb target, allowing us to analyze thousands of DNA traces in single cells. In cell types ranging from embryonic stem cells to brain tissue, we find that PcG-bound chromatin frequently explores decompact states and partial mixing with neighboring chromatin, while remaining uniformly repressed, challenging the repression-by-compaction model. Using polymer physics simulations, we show that the flexible ensembles we observe can be explained by dynamic contacts mediated by multivalent interactions that are too weak to induce phase separation. Instead, these transient contacts contribute to accurate propagation of the epigenetic state without ectopic spreading or gradual erosion. We propose that the distinctive 3D organization of Polycomb chromatin, reflects a mechanism of ``spatial feedback'' required for stable repression.},

We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3{${'}$}-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated. A more complete catalog of transcribed DNA of yeast is assembled by shotgun sequencing of messenger RNA and reveals numerous previously unknown transcribed regions.

These modified genes permit numerous applications including assessment of protein expression pattern, identification of protein interaction partners by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spec, and reversible removal of the tagged protein in any tissue. At present, these conversions remain time and labor-intensive as they require embryos to be injected with plasmid DNA containing the exon tag. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable genetic strategy to tag genes/proteins that contain MiMIC insertions using an integrated exon encoding GFP flanked by FRT sequences. We document the efficiency and tag 60 mostly uncharacterized genes.},

  abstract = {We investigate an ecological mechanism by which endosymbiotic associations evolve, with a particular focus on the relationship between the evolution of endosymbiosis between auto- and heterotrophic organisms, and the stages of ecosystem development. For this purpose we conducted a long-term microcosm culture composed of three species, a green alga (Chlorella vulgaris), a bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a ciliated protozoan (Tetrahymena thermophila) for 3 years. During this culture T. thermophila cells harboring Chlorella cells emerged by phagocytotic uptake, and increased in frequency, reaching ca. 80\textendash 90\%. This level was maintained in the late stage of ecosystem dynamics. Analysis of the ecosystem dynamics in the microcosm revealed that a complex causal process through direct/indirect interactions among ecosystem components led to reduction in dissolved O2 and food (E. coli) available to the T. thermophila, which gave a selective advantage to the organisms in the endosymbiotic association. This result suggests that the endosymbiosis evolves in a mature stage of ecosystem development, where reproduction and survival of prospective partner organisms is highly resource-limited and density-dependent, favoring efficient matter/energy transfers among participating organisms due to physical proximity. Consequently, a complex web of interactions and pathways of matter/energy flow in ecosystem evolves from an initially simple one.},

This gene encodes two BH3 domain\textendash containing proteins (PUMA-␣ and PUMA-␤) that are induced in cells following p53 activation. PUMA-␣ and PUMA-␤ show similar activities; they bind to Bcl-2, localize to the mitochondria to induce cytochrome c release, and activate the rapid induction of programmed cell death. Antisense inhibition of PUMA expression reduced the apoptotic response to p53, and PUMA is likely to play a role in mediating p53-induced cell death through the cytochrome c/Apaf-1\textendash dependent pathway.},

However, how these systems function to achieve transcriptional regulation remains very poorly understood. Here, we discover that the histone H2AK119 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is defined by the composition of its catalytic subunits and is highly regulated by RYBP/YAF2-dependent stimulation. In mouse embryonic stem cells, RYBP plays a central role in shaping H2AK119 mono-ubiquitylation at PcG targets and underpins an activity-based communication between PRC1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is required for normal histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Without normal histone modification-dependent communication between PRC1 and PRC2, repressive Polycomb chromatin domains can erode, rendering target genes susceptible to inappropriate gene expression signals. This suggests that activity-based communication and histone modification-dependent thresholds create a localized form of epigenetic memory required for normal PcG chromatin domain function in gene regulation.},

In Drosophila, they form multimeric complexes that bind to specific DNA regulatory elements named PcG response elements (PREs). To date, few PREs have been identified and the chromosomal distribution of PcG proteins during development is unknown. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with genomic tiling path microarrays to analyze the binding profile of the PcG proteins Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH) across 10 Mb of euchromatin. We also analyzed the distribution of GAGA factor (GAF), a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is found at most previously identified PREs. Our data show that PC and PH often bind to clustered regions within large loci that encode transcription factors which play multiple roles in developmental patterning and in the regulation of cell proliferation. GAF co-localizes with PC and PH to a limited extent, suggesting that GAF is not a necessary component of chromatin at PREs. Finally, the chromosome-association profile of PC and PH changes during development, suggesting that the function of these proteins in the regulation of some of their target genes might be more dynamic than previously anticipated.},

Nonetheless, much of how pioneer transcription factors coordinate changes in chromatin accessibility during development remains unknown. To determine whether pioneer-factor function is intrinsic to the protein or whether pioneering activity is developmentally modulated, we studied the highly conserved, essential transcription factor Grainy head (Grh). Prior work established that Grh is expressed throughout Drosophila development and is a pioneer factor in the larva. We demonstrated that Grh remains bound to mitotic chromosomes, a property shared with other pioneer factors. By assaying chromatin accessibility in embryos lacking maternal and/or zygotic Grh at three stages of development, we discovered that Grh is not required for chromatin accessibility in early embryogenesis, in contrast to its essential functions later in development. Our data reveal that the pioneering activity of Grh is temporally regulated and likely influenced by additional factors expressed at a given developmental stage.},

  abstract = {The propagation and maintenance of gene expression programs are at the foundation of the preservation of cell identity. A large and complex set of epigenetic mechanisms enables the long-term stability and inheritance of transcription states. A key property of authentic epigenetic regulation is being independent from the instructive signals used for its establishment. This makes epigenetic regulation, particularly epigenetic silencing, extremely robust and powerful to lock regulatory states and stabilise cell identity. In line with this, the establishment of epigenetic silencing during development restricts cell potency and maintains the cell fate choices made by transcription factors (TFs). However, how more immature cells that have not yet established their definitive fate maintain their transitory identity without compromising their responsiveness to signalling cues remains unclear. A paradigmatic example is provided by pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from a transient population of cells of the blastocyst. Here, we argue that ES cells represent an interesting ``epigenetic paradox'': even though they are captured in a self-renewing state characterised by extremely efficient maintenance of their identity, which is a typical manifestation of robust epigenetic regulation, they seem not to heavily rely on classical epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, self-renewal strictly depends on the TFs that previously instructed their undifferentiated identity and relies on a particular signalling-dependent chromatin state where repressive chromatin marks play minor roles. Although this ``epigenetic paradox'' may underlie their exquisite responsiveness to developmental cues, it suggests that alternative mechanisms to faithfully propagate gene regulatory states might be prevalent in ES cells.}

To isolate mutations that alter the activity of the 181-bp PRE, we screened for dominant suppressors of PRE-mediated mini-white repression. Dominant suppressors of mini-white repression were rare; we recovered only nine mutations out of 68,274 progeny screened. Two of the nine mutations isolated are due to the same single amino acid change in the transcriptional activator Woc (without children). Reversion experiments show that these are dominant gain-of-function mutations in woc. We suggest that Woc can interfere with the activity of the PRE.

These findings support a model wherein E93 expression functions as an instructive cue that defines a broad window of developmental time through control of chromatin accessibility.},

  abstract = {We tested the effect of systematic destruction of all three lac operators of the chromosomal lac operon of Escherichia coli on repression by Lac repressor. Absence of just one 'pseudo-operator' O2 or O3 decreases repression by wild-type tetrameric Lac repressor approximately 2- to 3-fold; absence of both 'pseudo-operators' decreases repression greater than 50-fold. O1 alone represses under these conditions only approximately 20-fold. Dimeric active Lac repressor (iadi) represses the wild-type lac operon to about the same low extent. This indicates that cooperative interaction between lac operators is due to DNA loop formation mediated by tetrameric Lac repressor. Under conditions where loop formation is impossible, occupation of O3 but not of O2 may lead to weak repression. This suggests that under these conditions CAP activation may be inhibited and that stopping transcription at O2 does not significantly contribute to repression.},

Within TADs, chromatin looping interactions are formed between DNA regulatory elements, but their functional importance for the establishment of the 3D genome organization and gene regulation during development is unclear. Using high-resolution Hi-C experiments, we analyze higher order 3D chromatin organization during Drosophila embryogenesis and identify active and repressive chromatin loops that are established with different kinetics and depend on distinct factors: Zelda-dependent active loops are formed before the midblastula transition between transcribed genes over long distances. Repressive loops within polycomb domains are formed after the midblastula transition between polycomb response elements by the action of GAGA factor and polycomb proteins. Perturbation of PRE function by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering affects polycomb domain formation and destabilizes polycomb-mediated silencing. Preventing loop formation without removal of polycomb components also decreases silencing efficiency, suggesting that chromatin architecture can play instructive roles in gene regulation during development.

We propose two hypotheses through which tissue patterning could be coordinated with whole-body development to generate this robustness. Our first hypothesis states that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time. The second hypothesis is that tissue patterning aligns at developmental milestones. To distinguish between our two hypotheses, we developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using the expression of canonical patterning genes, linking our scheme to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering and pupariation. We used our scheme to explore how the progression of pattern changes when developmental time is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis that drives developmental progression. We found the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. Between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Furthermore, our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage. Thus for wing disc patterning, wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone. Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. Furthermore, our work provides an important glimpse into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole.},

  abstract = {In Drosophila, the maintenance of developmentally important transcription patterns is controlled at the level of chromatin structure. The Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes encode proteins involved in chromatin remodelling. PcG genes have been proposed to act by packaging transcriptional repressed chromosomal domains into condensed heterochromatin-like structures. Some of the trxG proteins characterized so far are members of chromatin opening complexes (e.g. SWI/SNF and GAGA/NURF) which facilitate binding of transcription factors and components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Genetic and biochemical data suggest that these two groups of regulatory factors may act through a common set of DNA elements. In the present study, we have investigated the binding of Trithorax (TRX) and Polycomb (PC) protein in the bithorax complex (BX-C) during embryogenesis. In addition, we have identified the minimal fragments from the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) regulatory region that are capable of recruiting TRX to chromosomal sites containing them. Comparative analysis of the binding of the two proteins shows that TRX and PC bind target sequences (PcG-regulated elements, PREs) by cellular blastoderm, when BX-C transcription begins. At the same stage, TRX but not PC is strongly associated with core promoters. Later, at germ band extension, the time of derepression in Polycomb mutants, PC binding is also detected outside core PREs and additionally binds to the fragments containing promoters.},

Binding of multiple sequence-specific factors at discrete Polycomb response elements (PREs) is thought to recruit repressive complexes that spread across an extended chromatin domain. To dissect the structure of PREs, we applied high-resolution mapping of nonhistone chromatin proteins in native chromatin of Drosophila cells. Analysis of occupied sites reveal interactions between transcription factors that stabilize Polycomb anchoring to DNA, and implicate the general transcription factor ADF1 as a novel PRE component. By comparing two Drosophila cell lines with differential chromatin states, we provide evidence that repression is accomplished by enhanced Polycomb recruitment both to PREs and to target promoters of repressed genes. These results suggest that the stability of multifactor complexes at promoters and regulatory elements is a crucial aspect of developmentally regulated gene expression.},

Targeting PRCs to the correct sites in chromatin is essential for their function. However, the mechanisms by which PRCs are recruited to their target genes in mammals are multifactorial and complex. Here we review DNA binding by polycomb group proteins. There is strong evidence that the DNA-binding subunits of PRCs and their DNA-binding activities are required for chromatin binding and CpG targeting in cells. In vitro, CpG-specific binding was observed for truncated proteins externally to the context of their PRCs. Yet, the mere DNA sequence cannot fully explain the subset of CpG islands that are targeted by PRCs in any given cell type. At this time we find very little structural and biophysical evidence to support a model where sequence-specific DNA-binding activity is required or sufficient for the targeting of CpG-dinucleotide sequences by polycomb group proteins while they are within the context of their respective PRCs, either PRC1 or PRC2. We discuss the current knowledge and open questions on how the DNA-binding activities of polycomb group proteins facilitate the targeting of PRCs to chromatin.},

Despite these dramatic changes in the mother cell, daughter cells are able to faithfully re-establish the parental chromatin and gene expression features characteristic of the cell type. Pioneering studies of mitotic chromatin signatures showed that despite global repression of transcription, the Hsp70 gene promoter retains an open chromatin conformation, which was proposed to allow the reactivation of the Hsp70 gene upon completion of mitosis \textemdash{} a phenomenon termed mitotic bookmarking. It was later shown that various cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) in erythroblasts and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) in hepatocytes, remain bound at a subset of their interphase binding sites in mitosis. Such bookmarking transcription factors remain on chromosomes in mitosis and have been shown to enable a subset of genes to be reactivated in a timely fashion upon mitotic exit. In addition, sensitive new methods to measure transcription revealed that mitotic cells retain residual transcription at a large number of genes. Furthermore, genes recover their interphase level of~transcription in distinct waves. Thus, gene expression is precisely regulated as cells pass through mitosis to ensure faithful propagation of cell identity and function through cellular generations.},

To study the molecular basis of PcG/trxG control, we analyzed the chromatin of the HOX gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in UbxOFFand UbxONcells purified from developing Drosophila. We find that PcG protein complexes PhoRC, PRC1, and PRC2 and the Trx protein are all constitutively bound to Polycomb response elements (PREs) in the OFF and ON state. In contrast, the trxG protein Ash1 is only bound in the ON state; not at PREs but downstream of the transcription start site. In the OFF state, we find extensive trimethylation at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20 across the entire Ubx gene; i.e., throughout the upstream control, promoter, and coding region. In the ON state, the upstream control region is also trimethylated at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20, but all three modifications are absent in the promoter and 5{${'}$} coding region. Our analyses of mutants that lack the PcG histone methyltransferase (HMTase) E(z) or the trxG HMTase Ash1 provide strong evidence that differential histone lysine trimethylation at the promoter and in the coding region confers transcriptional ON and OFF states of Ubx. In particular, our results suggest that PRE-tethered PcG protein complexes act over long distances to generate Pc-repressed chromatin that is trimethylated at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20, but that the trxG HMTase Ash1 selectively prevents this trimethylation in the promoter and coding region in the ON state.},

What was initially thought to be a function restricted to a few target genes, subsequently turned out to be of much broader relevance, since the main role of PcG complexes is to ensure a dynamically choregraphed spatio-temporal regulation of their numerous target genes during development. Their ability to modify chromatin landscapes and refine the expression of master genes controlling major switches in cellular decisions under physiological conditions is often misregulated in tumors. Surprisingly, their functional implication in the initiation and progression of cancer may be either dependent on Polycomb complexes, or specific for a subunit that acts independently of other PcG members. In this review, we describe how misregulated Polycomb proteins play a pleiotropic role in cancer by altering a broad spectrum of biological processes such as the proliferation-differentiation balance, metabolism and the immune response, all of which are crucial in tumor progression. We also illustrate how interfering with PcG functions can provide a powerful strategy to counter tumor progression.},

Our structural analysis revealed five structural states of TFIID in the presence of TFIIA and promoter DNA, showing that the initial binding of TFIID to the downstream promoter positions the upstream DNA and facilitates scanning of TBP for a TATA box and the subsequent engagement of the promoter. Our findings provide a mechanistic model for the specific loading of TBP by TFIID onto the promoter.},

However, technical challenges have impaired the study of the molecular interactions coordinating cell fate choice and cell-cycle progression. Here, we bypass these limitations by using the FUCCI reporter system in human pluripotent stem cells and show that their capacity of differentiation varies during the progression of their cell cycle. These mechanisms are governed by the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1\textendash 3 that control differentiation signals such as the TGFb-Smad2/3 pathway. Conversely, cell-cycle manipulation using a small molecule directs differentiation of hPSCs and provides an approach to generate cell types with a clinical interest.

However, the epigenomic landscapes of eukaryotes are dominated by nucleosomes, which have acquired roles in genome packaging, mitotic condensation and silencing parasitic genomic elements. Although the molecular mechanisms by which nucleosomes are displaced and modified have been described, just how transcription factors, histone variants and modifications and chromatin regulators act on nucleosomes to regulate transcription is the subject of considerable ongoing study. We explore the extent to which these transcriptional regulatory components function in the context of the evolutionarily ancient role of chromatin as a barrier to processes acting on DNA and how chromatin proteins have diversified to carry out evolutionarily recent functions that accompanied the emergence of differentiation and development in multicellular eukaryotes.}

To identify further components of this pathway we isolated suppressors of nanos. In the absence of nanos high levels of Hb protein repress the abdomen-specific genes knirps and giant. In suppressor-of-nanos mutants, knirps and giant are expressed in spite of high Hb levels. The suppressors are alleles of Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) a member of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes. We show that E(z), and likely other Pc-G genes, are required for maintaining the expression domains of knirps and giant initiated by the maternal Hb protein gradient. We have identified a small region of the knirps promoter that mediates the regulation by E(z) and hb. Because Pc-G genes are thought to control gene expression by regulating chromatin, we propose that imprinting at the chromatin level underlies the determination of anteroposterior polarity in the early embryo.},

They generated Drosophila strains that lack H2Aub and found that repression of all canonical PRC1 target genes is maintained in the absence of H2Aub and that the mutant animals do not exhibit the phenotypes that are characteristic for mutants lacking Polycomb function. The findings suggest that the mechanism by which PRC1 represses gene transcription is independent of H2Aub., Histone H2A monoubiquitylation (H2Aub) is considered to be a key effector in transcriptional repression by Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1). We analyzed Drosophila with a point mutation in the PRC1 subunit Sce that abolishes its H2A ubiquitylase activity or with point mutations in the H2A and H2Av residues ubiquitylated by PRC1. H2Aub is essential for viability and required for efficient histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation by PRC2 early in embryogenesis. However, H2Aub-deficient animals fully maintain repression of PRC1 target genes and do not show phenotypes characteristic of Polycomb group mutants. PRC1 thus represses canonical target genes independently of H2Aub.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) protein is a transcriptional repressor of the Polycomb group (PcG). Although genetic studies establish SCM as a crucial PcG member, its molecular role is not known. To investigate how SCM might link to PcG complexes, we analyzed the in vivo role of a conserved protein interaction module, the SPM domain. This domain is found in SCM and in another PcG protein, Polyhomeotic (PH), which is a core component of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). SCM-PH interactions in vitro are mediated by their respective SPM domains. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays were used to isolate and characterize \&gt;30 missense mutations in the SPM domain of SCM. Genetic rescue assays showed that SCM repressor function in vivo is disrupted by mutations that impair SPM domain interactions in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of an isolated, wild-type SPM domain produced PcG loss-of-function phenotypes in flies. Coassembly of SCM with a reconstituted PRC1 core complex shows that SCM can partner with PRC1. However, gel filtration chromatography showed that the bulk of SCM is biochemically separable from PH in embryo nuclear extracts. These results suggest that SCM, although not a core component of PRC1, interacts and functions with PRC1 in gene silencing.},

Adults homozygous for temperature-sensitive pco alleles that were exposed to the restrictive temperature during larval life display the second and third leg to first leg transformation characteristic of polycomb-group mutants. Adult females homozygous for temperature-sensitive alleles exposed to the restrictive temperature during oogenesis produce embryos that show anterior segments with structures normally unique to the eighth abdominal segment, another transformation characteristic of polycomb-group mutants. Mutations in the polycombeotic gene also cause defects not reported for mutations in other polycomb-group genes. Females homozygous for the most extreme temperature-sensitive allele are sterile, and larvae homozygous for null alleles have small imaginal discs and reduced frequencies of mitotic figures in the brain. Dominant mutations originally identified as enhancers or suppressors of zeste are gain-of-function alleles of polycombeotic. The type and variety of defects displayed by different mutations in this gene indicate that the product might be involved in chromosome structure and/or function.},

  abstract = {Epistasis has been used to describe a number of phenomena, including the functional interaction between genes, the genetic outcome of mutations acting within the same genetic pathway, and the statistical deviation from additive gene action. Converging interests across genetics suggests that it is now time to develop a more unified view of epistasis and gene interactions.One of the traditional uses of epistasis analysis has been to order genes within developmental and metabolic pathways. These approaches have recently become much more systematic through the use of high-throughput genetic screens, especially in yeast. These studies show that gene interactions are ubiquitous and can be used to help understand the structure of complex genetic networks.The major limitation of comprehensive analyses of gene interactions is the total number of interactions that must ultimately be tested, which grows at approximately the square of the number of genes (for example, {$>$}18 million interactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome). Future work in this area will need to focus on particular subsets of this interaction space using information from other sources, such as functional genomics.Epistasis can be a major barrier to inferring the genetic basis of complex traits within natural populations. The effects of many QTLs might be obscured by interactions with other loci, which can make mapping difficult.Human genetic disease is one area in which epistasis seems to be fairly common, although we have few examples in which the functional basis of a particular interaction has been demonstrated. Epistasis is one possible explanation for why human mapping results can be difficult to replicate.Epistasis arises as a natural by-product of the evolutionary process, as all subsequent evolutionary change is built upon genetic changes that have occurred previously.There is clear evidence that epistasis helps to structure the possible pathways that evolution can follow but, even after nearly a century of debate on the topic, we still do not know if epistasis creates a major barrier to evolutionary change.An increased focus on the quantitative effects of gene interactions will provide the basis for a unified approach to studies of gene interaction, while providing a point of articulation between genetics, functional genomics, evolutionary genetics and systems biology.},

The Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) family complexes are central to maintaining this repression. These include a set of canonical PRC1 complexes, each of which contains four core proteins, including one from the CBX family. These complexes have been shown previously to reside in membraneless organelles called Polycomb bodies, leading to speculation that canonical PRC1 might be found in a separate phase from the rest of the nucleus. We show here that reconstituted PRC1 readily phase-separates into droplets in vitro at low concentrations and physiological salt conditions. This behavior is driven by the CBX2 subunit. Point mutations in an internal domain of Cbx2 eliminate phase separation. These same point mutations eliminate the formation of puncta in cells and have been shown previously to eliminate nucleosome compaction in vitro and generate axial patterning defects in mice. Thus, the domain of CBX2 that is important for phase separation is the same domain shown previously to be important for chromatin compaction and proper development, raising the possibility of a mechanistic or evolutionary link between these activities.},

These properties probably facilitate local H3K27me2/3 spreading, causing heterochromatin formation and gene repression. Here, cryo-EM reconstructions of human PRC2 bound to bifunctional dinucleosomes show how a single PRC2, via interactions with nucleosomal DNA, positions the H3 tails of the activating and substrate nucleosome to interact with the EED subunit and the SET domain of EZH2, respectively. We show how the geometry of the PRC2\textendash DNA interactions allows PRC2 to accommodate varying lengths of the linker DNA between nucleosomes.

  abstract = {Targeted protein inactivation (TPI) is an elegant approach to investigate protein function and its role in the cellular landscape, overcoming limitations of genetic perturbation strategies. These systems act in a reversible manner and reduce off-target effects exceeding the limitations of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference, respectively. Several TPI have been developed and wisely improved, including compartment delocalization tools and protein degradation systems. However, unlike chemical tools such as PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras), which work in a wild-type genomic background, TPI technologies require adding an aminoacidic signal sequence (tag) to the protein of interest (POI). On the other hand, the design and optimization of PROTACs are very laborious and time-consuming. In this review, we focus on anchor-away, deGradFP, auxin-inducible degron (AID) and dTAG technologies and discuss their recent applications and advances. Finally, we propose nano-grad, a novel nanobody-based protein degradation tool, which specifically proteolyzes endogenous tag-free target protein.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory evolution: (i) uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; (ii) minimizes the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene expression; and (iii) allows interactions to arise among any transcription factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest morphological differences among closely related species and more profound anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.},

Recently, the RNA-guidable feature of CRISPR-Cas9 has been utilized for imaging of chromatin within live cells. However, these methods are mostly applicable to highly repetitive regions, whereas imaging regions with low or no repeats remains as a challenge. To address this challenge, we design single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated with up to 16 MS2 binding motifs to enable robust fluorescent signal amplification. These engineered sgRNAs enable multicolour labelling of low-repeat-containing regions using a single sgRNA and of non-repetitive regions with as few as four unique sgRNAs. We achieve tracking of native chromatin loci throughout the cell cycle and determine differential positioning of transcriptionally active and inactive regions in the nucleus. These results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to monitor the position and dynamics of both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions in live cells.},

Recent epigenetic profiling during early mouse development revealed the presence of domains of trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) and chromatin compaction specifically at the maternally derived allele, independent of DNA methylation. Within these domains, genes are exclusively expressed from the paternally derived allele. This novel mechanism of noncanonical imprinting plays a key role in the development of mouse extraembryonic tissues and in the regulation of imprinted X-chromosome inactivation, highlighting the importance of parentally inherited epigenetic histone modifications. Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying H3K27me3-mediated noncanonical imprinting in perspective of the dynamic chromatin landscape during early mouse development and explore evolutionary origins of noncanonical imprinting.},

  abstract = {During development, neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning as they age to sequentially generate differently fated progeny. Temporal patterning of neural progenitors is relatively well-studied in Drosophila. Temporal cascades of transcription factors or opposing temporal gradients of RNA-binding proteins are expressed in neural progenitors as they age to control the fates of the progeny. The temporal progression is mostly driven by intrinsic mechanisms including cross-regulations between temporal genes, but environmental cues also play important roles in certain transitions. Vertebrate neural progenitors demonstrate greater plasticity in response to extrinsic cues. Recent studies suggest that vertebrate neural progenitors are also temporally patterned by a combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in response to extracellular signaling to regulate neural fate specification. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the study of temporal patterning of neural progenitors in Drosophila and vertebrates. We also discuss the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, specifically the Polycomb group complexes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, in the temporal patterning of neural progenitors.},

Here, we measure chromatin accessibility in isolated neural and mesodermal lineages across a time course of Drosophila embryogenesis. Promoters, including tissue-specific genes, are often constitutively open, even in contexts where the gene is not expressed. In contrast, the majority of distal elements have dynamic, tissue-specific accessibility. Enhancer priming appears rarely within a lineage, perhaps reflecting the speed of Drosophila embryogenesis. However, many tissue-specific enhancers are accessible in other lineages early on and become progressively closed as embryogenesis proceeds. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tissue- and time-resolved resource to definitively identify single-cell clusters, to uncover predictive motifs, and to identify many regulators of tissue development. For one such predicted neural regulator, l(3)neo38, we generate a loss-of-function mutant and uncover an essential role for neuromuscular junction and brain development.},

However, certain developmentally regulated genes lack histone 3 lysine 9 and 27 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) and histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, histone modifications common to most active genes. Here we describe a chromatin state featuring unique histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) peaks in key tissue-specific genes in Drosophila and human cells. Replacing H3K14 in Drosophila demonstrates that H3K14 is essential for expression of genes devoid of canonical histone modifications in the embryonic gut and larval wing imaginal disc, causing lethality and defective wing patterning. We find that the SWI/SNF protein Brahma (Brm) recognizes H3K14ac, that brm acts in the same genetic pathway as H3K14R, and that chromatin accessibility at H3K14ac-unique genes is decreased in H3K14R mutants. Our results show that acetylation of a single lysine is essential at genes devoid of canonical histone marks and uncover an important requirement for H3K14 in tissue-specific gene regulation.},

Researchers have begun to analyze the transcriptomes of donor, converting and target cells of Transdifferentiation with single cell resolution to compare transitional states to those found along the path of development. Here, we review examples of Transdifferentiation in a range of model systems and organisms.

The model accurately recapitulates published studies of PRE/TRE mediated epigenetic memory of both silencing and activation. With minimal parameter changes, the same model can also recapitulate experimental data for a different PRE/TRE that allows dynamic regulation of its target gene. The model predicts that both cell cycle length and PRE/TRE identity are critical for determining whether the system gives stable memory or dynamic regulation. Our work provides a simple unifying framework for a rich repertoire of PRE/TRE functions, and thus provides insights into~ genome-wide Polycomb/Trithorax regulation.},

We use ChIP-sequencing to identify L(3)mbt binding sites and show that L(3)mbt binds to chromatin insulator elements. Mutating l(3)mbt or inhibiting expression of the insulator protein gene mod(mdg4) results in upregulation of SWH pathway reporters. As l(3)mbt tumours are rescued by mutations in bantam or yorkie or by overexpression of Expanded, the deregulation of SWH pathway target genes is an essential step in brain tumour formation.

Drosophila PREs are well characterized, whereas the existence of PREs in mammals remains debated. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which CpG islands recruit Polycomb group (PcG) complexes; however, which subset of CGIs is selected to serve as PREs is unclear. Trithorax (Trx) positively regulates gene expression in Drosophila and co-occupies PREs to~antagonize Polycomb-dependent silencing. Here we~demonstrate that Trx-dependent H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) marks Drosophila PREs and maintains the developmental expression pattern of nearby genes. Similarly, the mammalian Trx homolog, MLL1, deposits H3K4me2 at CpG-dense regions that could~serve as PREs. In the absence of MLL1 and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 levels, a mark of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), increase at these loci. By inhibiting PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 in the absence of MLL1, we can rescue expression of these loci, demonstrating a functional balance between MLL1 and PRC2 activities at these sites. Thus, our study provides rules for identifying cell-type-specific~functional mammalian PREs within the human genome.},

Here, we show that knockout of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) does not lead to significant gene expression changes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and that it is dispensable for initiating silencing of target genes during differentiation. Transcriptional inhibition in mESCs is sufficient to induce genome-wide ectopic PRC2 recruitment to endogenous PcG target genes found in other tissues. PRC2 binding analysis shows that it is restricted to nucleosome-free CpG islands (CGIs) of untranscribed genes. Our results show that it is the transcriptional state that governs PRC2 binding, and we propose that it binds by default to nontranscribed CGI genes to maintain their silenced state and to protect cell identity.},

The time is ripe for a fruitful combination of these findings with two other long-running avenues of research, namely the biochemical properties of the PcG/TrxG system and the application of theoretical mathematical models toward an understanding of the system's regulatory properties.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data., Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org)., Contact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

  abstract = {A DNA sequence rich in (A+T), located upstream of the -10, -35 region of the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA promoter rrnB P1 and called the UP element, stimulates transcription by a factor of 30 in vivo, as well as in vitro in the absence of protein factors other than RNA polymerase (RNAP). When fused to other promoters, such as lacUV5, the UP element also stimulates transcription, indicating that it is a separate promoter module. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit of RNAP prevent stimulation of these promoters by the UP element although the mutant enzymes are effective in transcribing the "core" promoters (those lacking the UP element). Protection of UP element DNA by the mutant RNAPs is severely reduced in footprinting experiments, suggesting that the selective decrease in transcription might result from defective interactions between alpha and the UP element. Purified alpha binds specifically to the UP element, confirming that alpha acts directly in promoter recognition. Transcription of three other promoters was also reduced by the COOH-terminal alpha mutations. These results suggest that UP elements comprise a third promoter recognition region (in addition to the -10, -35 recognition hexamers, which interact with the sigma subunit) and may account for the presence of (A+T)-rich DNA upstream of many prokaryotic promoters. Since the same alpha mutations also block activation by some transcription factors, mechanisms of promoter stimulation by upstream DNA elements and positive control by certain transcription factors may be related.},

During dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo, specific ``mixer cells'' (MCs) are reprogrammed in a JNK-dependent manner to express the posterior determinant engrailed (en) and cross the segment boundary. Here, we show that JNK signaling induces de novo expression of en in the MCs through repression of Polycomb (Pc) and~release of the en locus from the silencing PcG bodies. Whereas reprogramming occurs in MCs from all thoracic and abdominal segments, cell mixing is restricted to the central abdominal region. We demonstrate that this spatial control of MC remodeling depends on the antagonist activity of the Hox genes abdominal-A and Abdominal-B. Together, these results reveal an essential JNK/en/Pc/Hox gene regulatory network important in controlling both the plasticity of segment boundaries and developmental reprogramming.},

In the last decades, genetic and developmental studies in the fruit fly have provided extensive knowledge regarding the mechanisms that direct the formation of the appendages. Importantly, many of the signaling pathways and patterning genes identified and characterized in Drosophila have similar functions during vertebrate appendage development. In this review, we will summarize the genetic and molecular mechanisms that lead to the specification of appendage primordia in the embryo and their posterior patterning during imaginal disc development. The identification of the regulatory logic underlying appendage specification in Drosophila suggests that the evolutionary origin of the insect wing is, in part, related to the development of ventral appendages.},

Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentified for a PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a unique trans-histone modification pattern that unambiguously resides within a single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these marks in the genome.

ASXLs and Asx use their DEUBiquitinase ADaptor (DEUBAD) domain to stimulate BAP1/Calypso DUB activity. Here we report that monoubiquitination of the DEUBAD is a general feature of ASXLs and Asx. BAP1 promotes DEUBAD monoubiquitination resulting in an increased stability of ASXL2, which in turn stimulates BAP1 DUB activity. ASXL2 monoubiquitination is directly catalyzed by UBE2E family of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and regulates mammalian cell proliferation. Remarkably, Calypso also regulates Asx monoubiquitination and transgenic flies expressing monoubiquitination-defective Asx mutant exhibit developmental defects. Finally, the protein levels of ASXL2, BAP1 and UBE2E enzymes are highly correlated in mesothelioma tumors suggesting the importance of this signaling axis for tumor suppression. We propose that monoubiquitination orchestrates a molecular symbiosis relationship between ASXLs and BAP1.}

However, the mechanisms underlying euchromatin establishment during early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is maintained from oocytes to fertilized embryos in Drosophila and mammals. H4K16ac forms large domains that control nucleosome accessibility of promoters prior to ZGA in flies. Maternal depletion of MOF acetyltransferase leading to H4K16ac loss causes aberrant RNA Pol II recruitment, compromises the 3D organization of the active genomic compartments during ZGA, and causes downregulation of post-zygotically expressed genes. Germline depletion of histone deacetylases revealed that other acetyl marks cannot compensate for H4K16ac loss in the oocyte. Moreover, zygotic re-expression of MOF was neither able to restore embryonic viability nor onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. Thus, maternal H4K16ac provides an instructive function to the offspring, priming future gene activation.},

Although studies in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed phenotypic associations between chromatin-modifying enzymes and their histone substrates, comparable studies in mammalian models do not exist3\textendash 5. Here, we use CRISPR base editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to address the regulatory role of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), a substrate for Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated methylation and CBP/EP300-mediated acetylation6,7. By generating pan-H3K27R (pK27R) mutant mESCs, where all 28 alleles of H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3 have been mutated, we demonstrate similarity in transcription patterns of genes and differentiation to PRC2-null mutants. Moreover, H3K27 acetylation is not essential for gene derepression linked to loss of H3K27 methylation, or de novo activation of genes during cell-fate transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). In conclusion, our results show that H3K27 is an essential substrate for PRC2 in mESCs, whereas other PTMs in addition to H3K27 acetylation are likely involved in mediating CBP/EP300 function. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale multicopy gene editing to interrogate histone PTM function in mammalian cells.},

Although much is known about their biochemical properties, how PRC1 and PRC2 are targeted to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we establish the Cyclin D2 (CCND2) oncogene as a simple model to address this question. We provide the evidence that coordinated recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to CCND2 involves a combination of a specialized PRC1 targeting element (PTE) and an adjacent CpG-island, which together act as a human Polycomb Response Element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of CCND2 in different transcriptional states indicates that histone modifications produced by PRC1 and PRC2 are not sufficient to recruit either of the complexes. However, catalytic activity of PRC2 helps to anchor PRC1 at the PTE. Our analyses suggest that coordinated targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes by juxtaposed AT-rich PTEs and CpG-islands is a general feature of Polycomb repression and advance our understanding of how the targeting has evolved.}

PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We found that PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted spinal motor neuron (MN) subtypes, while PRC2 activity is dispensable to maintain MN positional identities during terminal differentiation. Mutation of the core PRC1 component Ring1 in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including Hox transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in Ring1 mutants is due to the suppression of Hox-dependent specification programs by derepressed Hox13 paralogs (Hoxa13, Hoxb13, Hoxc13, Hoxd13). These results indicate that PRC1 can function in the absence of de novo PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and postmitotic neuronal fate.},

Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFb-insulin/ IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.},

Here we describe a modular system entitled CRISPaint (CRISPR-assisted insertion tagging) that allows precise and efficient integration of large heterologous DNA cassettes into eukaryotic genomes. CRISPaint makes use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce a double-strand break (DSB) at a user-defined genomic location. A universal donor DNA, optionally provided as minicircle DNA, is cleaved simultaneously to be integrated at the genomic DSB, while processing the donor plasmid at three possible positions allows flexible reading-frame selection. Applying this system allows to create C-terminal tag fusions of endogenously encoded proteins in human cells with high efficiencies. Knocking out known DSB repair components reveals that site-specific insertion is completely dependent on canonical NHEJ (DNA-PKcs, XLF and ligase-4). A large repertoire of modular donor vectors renders CRISPaint compatible with a wide array of applications.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group response elements (PREs) mediate the mitotic inheritance of gene expression programs and thus maintain determined cell fates. By default, PREs silence associated genes via the targeting of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes. Upon an activating signal, however, PREs recruit counteracting trithorax group (trxG) proteins, which in turn maintain target genes in a transcriptionally active state. Using a transgenic reporter system, we show that the switch from the silenced to the activated state of a PRE requires noncoding transcription. Continuous transcription through the PRE induced by an actin promoter prevents the establishment of PcG-mediated silencing. The maintenance of epigenetic activation requires transcription through the PRE to proceed at least until embryogenesis is completed. At the homeotic bithorax complex of Drosophila, intergenic PRE transcripts can be detected not only during embryogenesis, but also at late larval stages, suggesting that transcription through endogenous PREs is required continuously as an anti-silencing mechanism to prevent the access of repressive PcG complexes to the chromatin. Furthermore, all other PREs outside the homeotic complex we tested were found to be transcribed in the same tissue as the mRNA of the corresponding target gene, suggesting that anti-silencing by transcription is a fundamental aspect of the cellular memory system.},

  abstract = {The segmentation gene network of Drosophila consists of maternal and zygotic factors that generate, by transcriptional (cross-) regulation, expression patterns of increasing complexity along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Using known binding site information for maternal and zygotic gap transcription factors, the computer algorithm Ahab recovers known segmentation control elements (modules) with excellent success and predicts many novel modules within the network and genome-wide. We show that novel module predictions are highly enriched in the network and typically clustered proximal to the promoter, not only upstream, but also in intronic space and downstream. When placed upstream of a reporter gene, they consistently drive patterned blastoderm expression, in most cases faithfully producing one or more pattern elements of the endogenous gene. Moreover, we demonstrate for the entire set of known and newly validated modules that Ahab's prediction of binding sites correlates well with the expression patterns produced by the modules, revealing basic rules governing their composition. Specifically, we show that maternal factors consistently act as activators and that gap factors act as repressors, except for the bimodal factor Hunchback. Our data suggest a simple context-dependent rule for its switch from repressive to activating function. Overall, the composition of modules appears well fitted to the spatiotemporal distribution of their positive and negative input factors. Finally, by comparing Ahab predictions with different categories of transcription factor input, we confirm the global regulatory structure of the segmentation gene network, but find odd skipped behaving like a primary pair-rule gene. The study expands our knowledge of the segmentation gene network by increasing the number of experimentally tested modules by 50\%. For the first time, the entire set of validated modules is analyzed for binding site composition under a uniform set of criteria, permitting the definition of basic composition rules. The study demonstrates that computational methods are a powerful complement to experimental approaches in the analysis of transcription networks.},

It has been found that the phenotype of the regenerated antenna (aristapedia or wild-type) depends entirely on the temperature during which regeneration is accomplished and is therefore independent of the original temperature sensitive period.

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that regulate key developmental genes throughout development. In Drosophila, PcG and trxG factors bind to regulatory DNA elements called PcG and trxG response elements (PREs and TREs). Several DNA binding proteins have been suggested to recruit PcG proteins to PREs, but the DNA sequences necessary and sufficient to define PREs are largely unknown. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip assays to map the chromosomal distribution of Drosophila PcG proteins, the N- and C-terminal fragments of the Trithorax (TRX) protein and four candidate DNA-binding factors for PcG recruitment. In addition, we mapped histone modifications associated with PcG-dependent silencing and TRX-mediated activation. PcG proteins colocalize in large regions that may be defined as polycomb domains and colocalize with recruiters to form several hundreds of putative PREs. Strikingly, the majority of PcG recruiter binding sites are associated with H3K4me3 and not with PcG binding, suggesting that recruiter proteins have a dual function in activation as well as silencing. One major discriminant between activation and silencing is the strong binding of Pleiohomeotic (PHO) to silenced regions, whereas its homolog Pleiohomeotic-like (PHOL) binds preferentially to active promoters. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of TRX (TRX-C) showed high affinity to PcG binding sites, whereas the N-terminal fragment (TRX-N) bound mainly to active promoter regions trimethylated on H3K4. Our results indicate that DNA binding proteins serve as platforms to assist PcG and trxG binding. Furthermore, several DNA sequence features discriminate between PcG- and TRX-N\textendash bound regions, indicating that underlying DNA sequence contains critical information to drive PREs and TREs towards silencing or activation.},

  abstract = {Metazoan genomes are partitioned into modular chromosomal domains containing active or repressive chromatin. In flies, Polycomb group (PcG) response elements (PREs) recruit PHO and other DNA-binding factors and act as nucleation sites for the formation of Polycomb repressive domains. The sequence specificity of PREs is not well understood. Here, we use comparative epigenomics and transgenic assays to show that Drosophila domain organization and PRE specification are evolutionarily conserved despite significant cis-element divergence within Polycomb domains, whereas cis-element evolution is strongly correlated with transcription factor binding divergence outside of Polycomb domains. Cooperative interactions of PcG complexes and their recruiting factor PHO stabilize PHO recruitment to low-specificity sequences. Consistently, PHO recruitment to sites within Polycomb domains is stabilized by PRC1. These data suggest that cooperative rather than hierarchical interactions among low-affinity sequences, DNA-binding factors, and the Polycomb machinery are giving rise to specific and strongly conserved 3D structures in Drosophila.},

The genome is initially transcriptionally quiescent, allowing the zygote to be reprogrammed into a totipotent state. Gradually, the genome is activated through a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition, which enables zygotic gene products to replace the maternal supply that initiated development. This essential transition has been broadly characterized through decades of research in several model organisms. However, we still lack a full mechanistic understanding of how genome activation is executed and how this activation relates to the reprogramming of the zygotic chromatin architecture. Recent work highlights the central role of transcriptional activators and suggests that these factors may coordinate transcriptional activation with other developmental changes.},

Furthermore, new histones appear to be deposited onto DNA less than 1 min after passage of Pol II. Transcription-dependent deposition of histones requires the FACT complex that travels with elongating Pol II. Our results suggest that Pol II transcription generates a highly dynamic equilibrium of histone eviction and histone deposition and that there is significant histone exchange throughout most of the yeast genome within a single cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Polycomb (PcG) regulation has been thought to produce stable long-term gene silencing. Genomic analyses in Drosophila and mammals, however, have shown that it targets many genes, which can switch state during development. Genetic evidence indicates that critical for the active state of PcG target genes are the histone methyltransferases Trithorax (TRX) and ASH1. Here we analyze the repertoire of alternative states in which PcG target genes are found in different Drosophila cell lines and the role of PcG proteins TRX and ASH1 in controlling these states. Using extensive genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, RNAi knockdowns, and quantitative RT\textendash PCR, we show that, in addition to the known repressed state, PcG targets can reside in a transcriptionally active state characterized by formation of an extended domain enriched in ASH1, the N-terminal, but not C-terminal moiety of TRX and H3K27ac. ASH1/TRX N-ter domains and transcription are not incompatible with repressive marks, sometimes resulting in a ``balanced'' state modulated by both repressors and activators. Often however, loss of PcG repression results instead in a ``void'' state, lacking transcription, H3K27ac, or binding of TRX or ASH1. We conclude that PcG repression is dynamic, not static, and that the propensity of a target gene to switch states depends on relative levels of PcG, TRX, and activators. N-ter TRX plays a remarkable role that antagonizes PcG repression and preempts H3K27 methylation by acetylation. This role is distinct from that usually attributed to TRX/MLL proteins at the promoter. These results have important implications for Polycomb gene regulation, the ``bivalent'' chromatin state of embryonic stem cells, and gene expression in development.},

A conserved Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph) has been shown to play an important role in chromatin compaction and large-scale chromatin organization. Ph SAM forms helical head to tail polymers, and SAM-SAM interactions between chromatin-bound Ph/PRC1 are believed to compact chromatin and mediate long-range interactions. To understand the underlying mechanism, here we analyze the effects of Ph SAM on chromatin in vitro. We find that incubation of chromatin or DNA with a truncated Ph protein containing the SAM results in formation of concentrated, phase-separated condensates. Ph SAM-dependent condensates can recruit PRC1 from extracts and enhance PRC1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards histone H2A. We show that overexpression of Ph with an intact SAM increases ubiquitylated H2A in cells. Thus, SAM-induced phase separation, in the context of Ph, can mediate large-scale compaction of chromatin into biochemical compartments that facilitate histone modification.},

In many organisms, repetitive DNA is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin that is marked by di/trimethylation of histone H3K9 and the associated protein HP1a. These modifications enforce the unique epigenetic properties of heterochromatin. However, in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, the heterochromatin lacks these modifications, which appear only later, when rapid embryonic cell cycles slow down at the midblastula transition (MBT). Here we focus on the initial steps restoring heterochromatic modifications in the embryo. We describe the JabbaTrap, a technique for inactivating maternally provided proteins in embryos. Using the JabbaTrap, we reveal a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin. In contrast, other methyltransferases contribute minimally. Live imaging reveals that endogenous Eggless gradually accumulates on chromatin in interphase but then dissociates in mitosis, and its accumulation must restart in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle slowing as the embryo approaches the MBT permits increasing accumulation and action of Eggless at its targets. Experimental manipulation of interphase duration shows that cell cycle speed regulates Eggless. We propose that developmental slowing of the cell cycle times embryonic heterochromatin formation.},

Here we examine the role of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Using a combination of imaging and Hi-C analyses we show that PRC1-mediated long-range interactions are independent of CTCF and can bridge sites at a megabase scale. Impairment of PRC1 enzymatic activity does not directly disrupt these interactions. We demonstrate that PcG targets coalesce in vivo, and that developmentally induced expression of one of the target loci disrupts this spatial arrangement. Finally, we show that transcriptional activation and the loss of PRC1-mediated interactions are seperable events. These findings provide important insights into the function of PRC1, whilst highlighting the complexity of this regulatory system.}

  abstract = {The Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes play crucial roles in development by regulating expression of homeotic and other genes controlling cell fate. Both groups catalyse modifications of chromatin, particularly histone methylation, leading to epigenetic changes that affect gene activity. The trxG antagonizes the function of PcG genes by activating PcG target genes, and consequently trxG mutants suppress PcG mutant phenotypes. We previously identified the ANTAGONIST OF LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (ALP1) gene as a genetic suppressor of mutants in the Arabidopsis PcG gene LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). Here, we show that ALP1 interacts genetically with several other PcG and trxG components and that it antagonizes PcG silencing. Transcriptional profiling reveals that when PcG activity is compromised numerous target genes are hyper-activated in seedlings and that in most cases this requires ALP1. Furthermore, when PcG activity is present ALP1 is needed for full activation of several floral homeotic genes that are repressed by the PcG. Strikingly, ALP1 does not encode a known chromatin protein but rather a protein related to PIF/Harbinger class transposases. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ALP1 is broadly conserved in land plants and likely lost transposase activity and acquired a novel function during angiosperm evolution. Consistent with this, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) show that ALP1 associates, in vivo, with core components of POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2), a widely conserved PcG protein complex which functions as a H3K27me3 histone methyltransferase. Furthermore, in reciprocal pulldowns using the histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF), we identify not only ALP1 and the core PRC2 components but also plant-specific accessory components including EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF1), a transcriptional repressor previously associated with PRC1-like complexes. Taken together our data suggest that ALP1 inhibits PcG silencing by blocking the interaction of the core PRC2 with accessory components that promote its HMTase activity or its role in inhibiting transcription. ALP1 is the first example of a domesticated transposase acquiring a novel function as a PcG component. The antagonistic interaction of a modified transposase with the PcG machinery is novel and may have arisen as a means for the cognate transposon to evade host surveillance or for the host to exploit features of the transposition machinery beneficial for epigenetic regulation of gene activity.}

  abstract = {The critical process in development, bifurcation of cellular fates, requires epigenetic H3K27me3 marks propagated by PRC2 complex. However, the precise chromatin loci of functional H3K27me3 marks are not yet known. Here we identify critical PRC2 functional sites at a single nucleosome resolution. We fused a computationally designed protein, EED binder (EB) that competes with EZH2 and thereby disrupts PRC2 function, to dCas9 (EBdCas9) to direct PRC2 inhibition at a precise locus using gRNA. We targeted EBdCas9 to 4 different genes (TBX18, p16, CDX2 and GATA3) and observed epigenetic remodeling at a single nucleosome resolution resulting in gene activation. Remarkably, while traditional TATA box is located 30bp upstream of TSS, we identified a functional TATA box, {$>$}500bp of TSS, normally repressed by PRC2 complex. Deletion of this TATA box eliminates EBdCas9 dependent TBP recruitment and transcriptional activation. Targeting EBdCas9 to CDX2 and GATA3 results in trophoblast trans-differentiation. EBdCas9 technology is broadly applicable for epigenetic regulation at a single locus to control gene expression.

  abstract = {The development of all organisms relies on differential gene expression, which is controlled by genomic regions called enhancers or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Recent studies highlight the importance of enhancers in evolution and disease; however, our understanding of their properties and functions remains incomplete.Enhancers contain short DNA sequences, which are binding sites for transcription factors. In turn, transcription factors recruit cofactors, which modify the nearby chromatin and lead to transcriptional activation.The location of putative enhancers can be predicted genome wide by assessing either the binding of transcription factors and cofactors or post-translational histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP\textendash seq). 'Open' chromatin with accessible DNA can be detected by DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by deep sequencing (FAIRE\textendash seq) or assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq).Distal enhancers can activate target gene expression by looping to promoters. Such spatial contacts can be detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and its variants circular chromosome conformation capture (4C), chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) and Hi-C methods or by chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA\textendash PET, which is a combination of ChIP and various 3C-based methods).The genome-wide prediction of enhancers based on characteristic chromatin features is powerful, but such results have to be interpreted with caution because none of the known features is perfectly predictive.Enhancer activities of candidate sequences can be measured directly in a developmental context using image-based readouts or enhancer-FACS-seq. High-throughput parallel enhancer assays use either ectopic reporters to test thousands of candidates (which are based on DNA barcodes) or genome-wide screens (such as self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)).Our understanding of enhancer biology will be further accelerated by advances in genome editing methods (such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)\textendash Cas9 system), as well as by the development or improvements of methods to assess gene expression, chromatin state and structure in entire genomes and from increasingly few cells (such as thousands of reporters integrated in parallel (TRIP), single-cell RNA sequencing or ChIP\textendash seq, and high-resolution Hi-C).},

  abstract = {Histone lysine methylations have primarily been linked to selective recruitment of reader or effector proteins that subsequently modify chromatin regions and mediate genome functions. Here, we describe a divergent role for histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) and demonstrate that it directly facilitates chromatin openness and accessibility by disrupting chromatin folding. Thus, accumulation of H4K20me1 demarcates highly accessible chromatin at genes, and this is maintained throughout the cell cycle. In vitro, H4K20me1-containing nucleosomal arrays with nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL) of 187 and 197 are less compact than unmethylated (H4K20me0) or trimethylated (H4K20me3) arrays. Concordantly, and in contrast to trimethylated and unmethylated tails, solid-state NMR data shows that H4K20 mono-methylation changes the H4 conformational state and leads to more dynamic histone H4-tails. Notably, the increased chromatin accessibility mediated by H4K20me1 facilitates gene expression, particularly of housekeeping genes. Altogether, we show how the methylation state of a single histone H4 residue operates as a focal point in chromatin structure control. While H4K20me1 directly promotes chromatin openness at highly transcribed genes, it also serves as a stepping-stone for H4K20me3-dependent chromatin compaction.},

The deposition of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) by PRC2 is known to be required for transcriptional repression, whereas the contribution of H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) in the Polycomb repressive system remains unclear in plants. RESULTS We directly test the requirement of H2Aub for gene regulation in Marchantia polymorpha by generating point mutations in H2A that prevent ubiquitination by PRC1. These mutants show reduced H3K27me3 levels on the same target sites as mutants defective in PRC1 subunits MpBMI1 and the homolog MpBMI1L, revealing that PRC1-catalyzed H2Aub is essential for Polycomb system function. Furthermore, by comparing transcriptome data between mutants in MpH2A and MpBMI1/1L, we demonstrate that H2Aub contributes to the PRC1-mediated transcriptional level of genes and transposable elements. CONCLUSION Together, our data demonstrates that H2Aub plays a direct role in H3K27me3 deposition and is required for PRC1-mediated transcriptional changes in both genes and transposable elements in Marchantia.}

  abstract = {Rationale:   We have previously shown that innate immunity is necessary for transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to endothelial cells. A major signaling molecule involved in innate immunity is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Accordingly, we hypothesized that iNOS-generated nitric oxide (NO) might enhance transdifferentiation.     Objective:   To elucidate the role of NO in epigenetic plasticity during transdifferentiation.     Methods and Results:   We exposed the BJ fibroblasts to transdifferentiation formulation that included endothelial growth factors and innate immune activator polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC) to induce endothelial cells (iECs). Generation of iECs was associated with iNOS expression and NO elaboration. In absence of PIC, or in presence of antagonists of NF{$\kappa$}B or iNOS activity, NO synthesis and iEC generation was reduced. Furthermore, genetic knockout (in MEFs) or siRNA knockdown (in BJ fibroblasts) of iNOS nearly abolished transdifferentiation, an effect which could be reversed by iNOS overexpression. Notably, PIC induced nuclear localization of iNOS, and its binding to, and nitrosylation of, the epigenetic modifier RING1A as assessed by immunostaining, Co-IP and mass spectrometry. Nitrosylation of RING1A reduced its binding to chromatin, and reduced global levels of repressive histone marker H3K27trimethylation. Overexpression of a mutant form of RING1A (C398A) lacking the nitrosylation site almost abrogated transdifferentiation.     Conclusions:   Overall, our data indicates that during transdifferentiation, innate immune activation increases iNOS generation of NO to S-nitrosylate RING1A, a key member of the polycomb repressive complex. Nitrosylation of RING1A reduces its binding to chromatin and decreases H3K27trimethylation level. The release of epigenetic repression by nitrosylation of RING1A is critical for effective transdifferentiation.}

  abstract = {Background: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in silico is key in understanding gene regulation. TFBS are string patterns that exhibit some variability, commonly modelled as ``position weight matrices'' (PWMs). Though convenient, the PWM has significant limitations, in particular the assumed independence of positions within the binding motif; and predictions based on PWMs are usually not very specific to known functional sites. Analysis here on binding sites in yeast suggests that correlation of dinucleotides is not limited to near-neighbours, but can extend over considerable gaps. Methodology/Principal Findings: I describe a straightforward generalization of the PWM model, that considers frequencies of dinucleotides instead of individual nucleotides. Unlike previous efforts, this method considers all dinucleotides within an extended binding region, and does not make an attempt to determine a priori the significance of particular dinucleotide correlations. I describe how to use a ``dinucleotide weight matrix'' (DWM) to predict binding sites, dealing in particular with the complication that its entries are not independent probabilities. Benchmarks show, for many factors, a dramatic improvement over PWMs in precision of predicting known targets. In most cases, significant further improvement arises by extending the commonly defined ``core motifs'' by about 10bp on either side. Though this flanking sequence shows no strong motif at the nucleotide level, the predictive power of the dinucleotide model suggests that the ``signature'' in DNA sequence of protein-binding affinity extends beyond the core protein-DNA contact region. Conclusion/Significance: While computationally more demanding and slower than PWM-based approaches, this dinucleotide method is straightforward, both conceptually and in implementation, and can serve as a basis for future improvements.},

This concept has its merits and its pitfalls. Among the merits is the notion, elicited by the combined two terms of (i) aerobic metabolism as a steady-state redox balance and (ii) the associated potential strains in the balance as denoted by the term, stress, evoking biological stress responses. Current research on molecular redox switches governing oxidative stress responses is in full bloom. The fundamental importance of linking redox shifts to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling is being more fully appreciated, thanks to major advances in methodology. Among the pitfalls is the fact that the underlying molecular details are to be worked out in each particular case, which is bvious for a global concept, but which is sometimes overlooked. This can lead to indiscriminate use of the term, oxidative stress, without clear relation to redox chemistry. The major role in antioxidant defense is fulfilled by antioxidant enzymes, not by small-molecule antioxidant compounds. The field of oxidative stress research embraces chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, physiology and pathophysiology, all the way to medicine and health and disease research.},

In every case, both abdA and AbdB are expressed outside of their normal domains along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis, consistent with these Pc group products acting in a single pathway or molecular complex. The earliest detectable ectopic expression is highest in the parasegments immediately adjacent to the normal expression boundary. Surprisingly, in the most severe Pc group mutants, the earliest ectopic AbdB is distributed in a pair-rule pattern. At all stages, ectopic abdA in the epidermis is highest along the anterior edges of the parasegments, in a pattern that mimics the normal abdA cell-specific pattern. These examples of highly patterned mis-expression show that Pc group mutations do not cause indiscriminate activation of homeotic products. We suggest that the ectopic expression patterns result from factors that normally activate abdA and AbdB only in certain parasegments, but that in Pc group mutants these factors gain access to regulatory DNA in all parasegments.},

This is exerted by two distinct repressive complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, that modify histones by depositing H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively. Both complexes are essential for development and are deregulated in several types of human tumors. PRC1 and PRC2 exist in different variants and show a complex regulatory cross-talk. However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Coupling an inducible system with the expression of a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target genes repressed in ESC. Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This affected both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 variants and further correlated with a strong displacement and destabilization of canonical PRC1. Finally, we find that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as central hub that mount PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity.}

CUT\&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only \textasciitilde 1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT\&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT\&RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Key discoveries in \emph{Drosophila} have shaped our understanding of cellular ``enhancers.'' With a special focus on the fly, this chapter surveys properties of these adaptable \emph{cis}-regulatory elements, whose actions are critical for the complex spatial/temporal transcriptional regulation of gene expression in metazoa. The powerful combination of genetics, molecular biology, and genomics available in \emph{Drosophila} has provided an arena in which the developmental role of enhancers can be explored. Enhancers are characterized by diverse low- or high-throughput assays, which are challenging to interpret, as not all of these methods of identifying enhancers produce concordant results. As a model metazoan, the fly offers important advantages to comprehensive analysis of the central functions that enhancers play in gene expression, and their critical role in mediating the production of phenotypes from genotype and environmental inputs. A major challenge moving forward will be obtaining a quantitative understanding of how these \emph{cis}-regulatory elements operate in development and disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Sequencing of the clones led to the identification of 203 Engrailed-binding fragments localized in intergenic or intronic regions. Genes lying near these fragments, which are considered as potential Engrailed target genes, are involved in different developmental pathways, such as anteroposterior patterning, muscle development, tracheal pathfinding or axon guidance. We validated this approach by in vitro and in vivo tests performed on a subset of Engrailed potential targets involved in these various pathways. Finally, we present strong evidence showing that an immunoprecipitated genomic DNA fragment corresponds to a promoter region involved in the direct regulation of frizzled2 expression by engrailed in vivo.},

However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-DNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.},

However, it remains unknown how timely activation of this group of germline genes is accomplished. Here we show that Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) directs timely activation of germline genes during spermatogenesis. Inactivation of PRC1 in male germ cells results in the gradual loss of a stem cell population and severe differentiation defects, leading to male infertility. In the stem cell population, RNF2, the dominant catalytic subunit of PRC1, activates transcription of Sall4, which codes for a transcription factor essential for subsequent spermatogenic differentiation. Furthermore, RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy transcription start sites of germline genes in the stem cell population. Once differentiation commences, these germline genes are activated to enable the progression of spermatogenesis. Our study identifies a novel mechanism by which Polycomb directs the developmental process by activating a group of lineage-specific genes.}

FoxA, the paradigm pioneer TF, has a winged helix DBD that resembles linker histone and thereby binds its target sites on nucleosomes and in compacted chromatin. Herein, we compare the nucleosome and chromatin targeting activities of Oct4 (POU DBD), Sox2 (HMG box DBD), Klf4 (zinc finger DBD), and c-Myc (bHLH DBD), which together reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. Purified Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 proteins can bind nucleosomes in vitro, and in vivo they preferentially target silent sites enriched for nucleosomes. Pioneer activity relates simply to the ability of a given DBD to target partial motifs displayed on the nucleosome surface. Such partial motif recognition can occur by coordinate binding between factors. Our findings provide insight into how pioneer factors can target naive chromatin sites.},

The new RNAi inheritance factors exhibit mortal germline (Mrt) phenotypes, which we show is likely caused by epigenetic deregulation in germ cells. We also show that HRDE-2 contributes to RNAi inheritance by facilitating the binding of small RNAs to the inheritance Argonaute (Ago) HRDE-1. Together, our results identify additional components of the RNAi inheritance machinery whose conservation provides insights into the molecular mechanism of RNAi inheritance, further our understanding of how the RNAi inheritance machinery promotes germline immortality, and show that HRDE-2 couples the inheritance Ago HRDE-1 with the small RNAs it needs to direct RNAi inheritance and germline immortality.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These discs give rise to a high percentage of adult structures that are found within the adult fly. Here we describe a protocol that has been optimized to recover these discs and prepare them for analysis with antibodies, transcriptional reporters and protein traps. This procedure is best suited for thin tissues like imaginal discs, but can be easily modified for use with thicker tissues such as the larval brain and adult ovary. The written protocol and accompanying video will guide the reader/viewer through the dissection of third instar larvae, fixation of tissue, and treatment of imaginal discs with antibodies. The protocol can be used to dissect imaginal discs from younger first and second instar larvae as well. The advantage of this protocol is that it is relatively short and it has been optimized for the high quality preservation of the dissected tissue. Another advantage is that the fixation procedure that is employed works well with the overwhelming number of antibodies that recognize Drosophila proteins. In our experience, there is a very small number of sensitive antibodies that do not work well with this procedure. In these situations, the remedy appears to be to use an alternate fixation cocktail while continuing to follow the guidelines that we have set forth for the dissection steps and antibody incubations.},

We found that hormone-induced DHSs were enriched within {$\pm$}50 kb of GR-responsive genes and displayed a broad spectrum of lifetimes upon hormone withdrawal. These lifetimes dictate the strength of the DHS interactions with gene targets and contribute to gene regulation from a distance.

Here, we performed sequence analysis of a regulatory upstream section of MEF2C in T-ALL cell lines which, however, proved devoid of mutations. Unexpectedly, we found strong conservation between the regulatory upstream region of MEF2C (located at chromosomal band 5q14) and an intergenic stretch at 7q11 located between STAG3L4 and AUTS2, covering nearly 20 kb. While the non-coding gene STAG3L4 was inconspicuously expressed, AUTS2 was aberrantly upregulated in 6\% of T-ALL patients (public dataset GSE42038) and in 3/24 T-ALL cell lines, two of which represented very immature differentiation stages. AUTS2 expression was higher in normal B-cells than in T-cells, indicating lineage-specific activity in lymphopoiesis. While excluding chromosomal aberrations, examinations of AUTS2 transcriptional regulation in T-ALL cells revealed activation by IL7-IL7R-STAT5-signalling and MEF2C. AUTS2 protein has been shown to interact with polycomb repressor complex 1 subtype 5 (PRC1.5), transforming this particular complex into an activator. Accordingly, expression profiling and functional analyses demonstrated that AUTS2 activated while PCGF5 repressed transcription of NKL homeobox gene MSX1 in T-ALL cells. Forced expression and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in addition to H3K27me3 analysis indicated that PRC2 repressed MSX1 as well. Taken together, we found that AUTS2 and MEF2C, despite lying on different chromosomes, share strikingly similar regulatory upstream regions and aberrant expression in T-ALL subsets. Our data implicate chromatin complexes PRC1/AUTS2 and PRC2 in a gene network in T-ALL regulating early lymphoid differentiation.}

  abstract = {The conserved Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are transcriptional regulators, with several hundred target genes. Disruption of PcG or TrxG protein function can cause developmental defects and cancer.The PcG and TrxG proteins are recruited to cis-regulatory elements called Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs). The PcG and TrxG proteins act antagonistically through PREs to maintain silent and active gene expression states, respectively. These states are initiated by transcription factors that act at enhancers and are maintained by PcG and TrxG proteins at the PRE.Epigenetic memory is defined as the maintenance of gene expression states through cell generations in the absence of the initiating signals. PREs were first discovered in flies, in which they can mediate epigenetic memory of both silent and active states of their associated genes. Epigenetic memory has not yet been tested for mammalian PREs.Silent and activated states are each ensured by several self-reinforcing molecular mechanisms that act on chromatin and are mediated by the PcG and TrxG proteins. These include covalent modifications of chromatin, structural changes and modulation of RNA polymerase II activity. Mechanisms of silencing and activation antagonize each other.During the cell cycle, replication and mitosis are the stages at which epigenetic memory is most likely to be erased. Each stage presents a different molecular challenge to memory.During replication, newly assembled chromatin is acetylated and may favour an active PRE but challenge a silent one. Several PcG and TrxG proteins remain bound to replicating chromatin and may transmit memory to daughter strands.During mitosis, many proteins dissociate from chromatin and transcription shuts down. This may favour a silent PRE but challenge an active one. Several PcG and TrxG proteins remain bound to mitotic chromatin and may 'bookmark' silent and active states.Many PcG and TrxG target genes are dynamically regulated during development and do not display long-term epigenetic memory. For these targets, the PcG and TrxG proteins may reinforce or amplify transcriptional levels over shorter timescales. This may add robustness to gene regulation.},

Developing cells share a proportion of their DHS landscapes with ESCs; that proportion decreases continuously in each cell type as differentiation progresses, providing a quantitative benchmark of developmental maturity. Developmentally stable DHSs densely encode binding sites for transcription factors involved in autoregulatory feedback circuits. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells extensively reactivate silenced ESC DHSs and those from developmental programs external to the cell lineage from which the malignancy derives.

From these studies, two mediators of cellular differentiation were discovered: the Polycomb group (PcG) of transcriptional repressors, and the trithorax group (trxG) of transcriptional activators. These protein families, while opposed in function, work together to coordinate the appropriate cellular developmental programs that allow for both embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Recently, both the PcG and trxG chromatin modulators have been observed to be deregulated in a wide spectrum diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. To understand the impact of these findings we outline the past, present, and future.

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

The OBF.1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner, being most abundant in B cells and essentially absent in most of the other cells or tissues tested. Furthermore, expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site-dependent manner.

We find that the esc' gene product is required during a discrete period of embryogenesis. If the gene product is absent or inactive during this period, most segments develop like the eighth abdominal segment. In contrast, absence of active gene product before or after this period has relatively little effect on segmental development.

Here we describe the spatial and temporal patterns of transcription of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene in mutant esc embryos. In wild-type embryos, Ubx transcripts are first detected in the blastoderm primorida of particular thoracic and abdominal segments, predominately in a band of cells constituting the progenitor cells of parasegment 6: after gastrulation, high levels of transcript accumulate in a sharply restricted region of the germ band comprising parasegments 6-12. In esc- embryos, the initial pattern of Ubx transcripts appears indistinguishable from that of wild-type embryos. However, following gastrulation and germ band extension, Ubx transcripts accumulate in most of the ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives of the body, including those of all 14 parasegments. Then, the abundance of the transcripts declines so that after germ band shortening (12 h after fertilization), only low levels are detected in each parasegment. These results show that the esc gene product is not involved in choosing where the Ubx gene is to be expressed, but rather, that it acts subsequently to ensure that the gene remains off in those primordia in which it is not initially activated. In addition, they suggest the possibility that other homeotic genes may regulate Ubx expression --in this case, the accumulating products of other indiscriminately expressed homeotic genes serving to down-regulate Ubx transcription throughout the body.},

However, how it controls transcription to enable gene repression has remained enigmatic. Here we employ rapid degron-based depletion coupled with live-cell transcription imaging and single-particle tracking to uncover how the Polycomb system controls transcription in single cells. We discover that the Polycomb system is not a constitutive block to transcription but instead sustains a long-lived deep promoter OFF-state which limits the frequency with which the promoter can enter into a transcribing state. We demonstrate that Polycomb sustains this deep promoter OFF-state by counteracting the binding of factors that enable early transcription pre-initiation complex formation and show that this is necessary for gene repression. Together these important discoveries provide a new rationale for how the Polycomb system controls transcription and suggests a universal mechanism that could enable the Polycomb system to constrain transcription across diverse cellular contexts.},

  abstract = {Is it possible to  enjoy  both  economic  growth  and  environmental  sustainability?  This  question  is  a  matter  of  fierce  political  debate  between  green  growth  and  post-growth  advocates.  Over  the past  decade,  green  growth  clearly  dominated  policy-making  with  policy  agendas  at  the  United  Nations, European Union, and in numerous countries building on the assumption that decoupling environmental pressures from gross domestic product (GDP) could allow future economic growth without end.  Considering what is at stake, a careful assessment to determine whether the scientific foundations behind  this  ``decoupling  hypothesis''  are  robust  or  not  is  needed.  This  report  reviews  the  empirical  and  theoretical  literature  to  assess  the  validity  of  this  hypothesis.  The  conclusion  is  both overwhelmingly clear and sobering: not only is there no empirical evidence supporting the existence of a decoupling of economic growth from environmental pressures on anywhere near the scale needed to deal with environmental breakdown, but also, and perhaps more importantly, such decoupling appears unlikely to happen in the future.  It is urgent to chart the consequences of these findings in terms of policy-making and prudently move  away  from  the  continuous  pursuit  of  economic  growth  in  high-consumption  countries.  More precisely, existing policy strategies aiming to increase efficiency have to be complemented by the pursuit of sufficiency, that is the direct downscaling of economic production in many sectors and parallel reduction of consumption that together will enable the good life within the planet's ecological limits. In the view of the authors of this report and based on the best available scientific evidence, only such strategies respect the EU's `precautionary principle', the principle that when the stakes are high and the outcomes uncertain, one should err on the side of caution.  The fact that decoupling on its own, i.e. without addressing the issue of economic growth, has not been and will not be sufficient to reduce environmental pressures to the required extent is not a reason to oppose decoupling (in the literal sense of separating the environmental pressures curve from  the  GDP  curve)  or  the  measures  that  achieve  decoupling  -  on  the  contrary,  without  many  such  measures  the  situation  would  be  far  worse.  It  is  a  reason  to  have  major  concerns  about  the  predominant  focus  of  policymakers  on  green  growth,  this  focus  being  based  on  the  flawed assumption  that  sufficient  decoupling  can  be  achieved  through  increased  efficiency  without limiting economic production and consumption.},

Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development.

  abstract = {Cytosine methylation in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been elusive and controversial: Its location and function have not been established. We have used a novel and highly sensitive genomewide cytosine methylation assay to detect and map genome methylation in stage 5 Drosophila embryos. The methylation we observe with this method is highly localized and strand asymmetrical, limited to regions covering {$\sim$}1\% of the genome, dynamic in early embryogenesis, and concentrated in specific 5-base sequence motifs that are CA- and CT-rich but depleted of guanine. Gene body methylation is associated with lower expression, and many genes containing methylated regions have developmental or transcriptional functions. The only known DNA methyltransferase in Drosophila is the DNMT2 homolog MT2, but lines deficient for MT2 retain genomic methylation, implying the presence of a novel methyltransferase. The association of methylation with a lower expression of specific developmental genes at stage 5 raises the possibility that it participates in controlling gene expression during the maternal-zygotic transition.},

  abstract = {Mapping neural circuits across defined synapses is essential for understanding brain function. Here we describe trans-Tango, a technique for anterograde transsynaptic circuit tracing and manipulation. At the core of trans-Tango is a synthetic signaling pathway that is introduced into all neurons in the animal. This pathway converts receptor activation at the~cell surface into reporter expression through site-specific proteolysis. Specific labeling is achieved by presenting a tethered ligand at the synapses of genetically defined neurons, thereby activating the pathway in their postsynaptic partners and providing genetic access to these neurons. We first validated trans-Tango in the Drosophila olfactory system and then implemented it in the gustatory system, where projections beyond the first-order receptor neurons are not fully characterized. We identified putative second-order neurons within the sweet circuit that include projection neurons targeting known neuromodulation centers in the brain. These experiments establish trans-Tango as a flexible platform for transsynaptic circuit analysis.},

PRC1 and PRC2 exist~in different variants and show a complex regulatory cross-talk. However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Using a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target gene repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This preferentially affected PRC2.2 variant with respect to PRC2.1, destabilizing canonical PRC1 activity. Finally, we found that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall, our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as a central hub that mounts PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity.},

  abstract = {Fluctuation ('noise') in gene expression is critical for mammalian cellular processes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to its origins, yet the mechanisms behind large fluctuations that are induced by single transcriptional activators remain elusive. Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the modulation of noise in synthetic and endogenous gene expression systems.},

We present the first dedicated ATAC-seq analysis tool, a semi-supervised machine learning approach named HMMRATAC. HMMRATAC splits a single ATAC-seq dataset into nucleosome-free and nucleosome-enriched signals, learns the unique chromatin structure around accessible regions, and then predicts accessible regions across the entire genome.

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins repress master regulators of development and differentiation through organization of chromatin structure. Mutation and dysregulation of PcG genes cause developmental defects and cancer. PcG proteins form condensates in the cell nucleus, and these condensates are the physical sites of PcG-targeted gene silencing via formation of facultative heterochromatin. However, the physiochemical principles underlying the formation of PcG condensates remain unknown, and their determination could shed light on how these condensates compact chromatin. Using fluorescence live-cell imaging, we observed that the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) protein chromobox 2 (CBX2), a member of the CBX protein family, undergoes phase separation to form condensates and that the CBX2 condensates exhibit liquid-like properties. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the conserved residues of CBX2 within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is the region for compaction of chromatin in vitro, promote the condensate formation both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the CBX2 condensates concentrate DNA and nucleosomes. Using genetic engineering, we report that trimethylation of Lys-27 at histone H3 (H3K27me3), a marker of heterochromatin formation produced by PRC2, had minimal effects on the CBX2 condensate formation. We further demonstrated that the CBX2 condensate formation does not require CBX2\textendash PRC1 subunits; however, the condensate formation of CBX2\textendash PRC1 subunits depends on CBX2, suggesting a mechanism underlying the assembly of CBX2\textendash PRC1 condensates. In summary, our results reveal that PcG condensates assemble through liquid\textendash liquid phase separation (LLPS) and suggest that phase-separated condensates can organize PcG-bound chromatin.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is regulated in part by protein complexes containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors of the SWI/SNF family. In Drosophila there is only one SWI/SNF protein, named Brahma, which forms the catalytic subunit of two complexes composed of different proteins. The protein Osa defines the BAP complex, and the proteins Polybromo and Bap170 are only present in the complex named PBAP. In this work we have analysed the functional requirements of Osa during Drosophila wing development, and found that osa is needed for cell growth and survival in the wing imaginal disc, and for the correct patterning of sensory organs, veins and the wing margin. Other members of the BAP complex, such as Snr1, Bap55, Mor and Brm, also share these functions of Osa. We focused on the requirement of Osa during the formation of the wing veins. Genetic interactions between osa alleles and mutations affecting the activity of the EGFR pathway suggest that one aspect of Osa is intimately related to the response to EGFR activity. Thus, loss of osa and EGFR signalling results in similar wing vein phenotypes, and osa alleles enhance the loss of veins caused by reduced EGFR activity. In addition, Osa is required for the expression of several targets of EGFR signalling, such as Delta, rhomboid and argos. We suggest that one role of Osa and Brm in the wing is to establish a chromatin environment in the regulatory regions of EGFR target genes, making them available for both activators and repressors and facilitating transcription in response to EGFR signalling.},

However, the mechanisms that temporally and spatially control the activation or repression of important genes during regeneration are not fully understood. To determine the role that chromatin modifiers play in regulating gene expression after tissue damage, we induced ablation in Drosophila melanogaster imaginal wing discs, and screened for chromatin regulators that are required for epithelial tissue regeneration. Here, we show that many of these genes are indeed important for promoting or constraining regeneration. Specifically, the two SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes play distinct roles in regulating different aspects of regeneration. The PBAP complex regulates regenerative growth and developmental timing, and is required for the expression of JNK signaling targets and the growth promoter Myc. By contrast, the BAP complex ensures correct patterning and cell fate by stabilizing the expression of the posterior gene engrailed. Thus, both SWI/SNF complexes are essential for proper gene expression during tissue regeneration, but they play distinct roles in regulating growth and cell fate.},

  abstract = {Trithorax (TRX) antagonizes epigenetic silencing by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, stimulates enhancer-dependent transcription, and establishes a `cellular memory' of active transcription of PcG-regulated genes. The mechanisms underlying these TRX functions remain largely unknown, but are presumed to involve its histone H3K4 methyltransferase activity. We report that the SET domains of TRX and TRX-related (TRR) have robust histone H3K4 monomethyltransferase activity in vitro and that Tyr3701 of TRX and Tyr2404 of TRR prevent them from being trimethyltransferases. The trxZ11 missense mutation (G3601S), which abolishes H3K4 methyltransferase activity in vitro, reduces the H3K4me1 but not the H3K4me3 level in vivo. trxZ11 also suppresses the impaired silencing phenotypes of the Pc3 mutant, suggesting that H3K4me1 is involved in antagonizing Polycomb silencing. Polycomb silencing is also antagonized by TRX-dependent H3K27 acetylation by CREB-binding protein (CBP). We show that perturbation of Polycomb silencing by TRX overexpression requires CBP. We also show that TRX and TRR are each physically associated with CBP in vivo, that TRX binds directly to the CBP KIX domain, and that the chromatin binding patterns of TRX and TRR are highly correlated with CBP and H3K4me1 genome-wide. In vitro acetylation of H3K27 by CBP is enhanced on K4me1-containing H3 substrates, and independently altering the H3K4me1 level in vivo, via the H3K4 demethylase LSD1, produces concordant changes in H3K27ac. These data indicate that the catalytic activities of TRX and CBP are physically coupled and suggest that both activities play roles in antagonizing Polycomb silencing, stimulating enhancer activity and cellular memory.},

This highly specialized transcriptional program is tightly controlled at the chromatin level in the female germline. As an extreme case in point, the massive and specific ovarian expression of the essential thioredoxin Deadhead (DHD) is critically regulated in Drosophila by the histone demethylase Lid and its partner, the histone deacetylase complex Sin3A/Rpd3, via yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we identified Snr1 and Mod(mdg4) as essential for dhd expression and investigated how these epigenomic effectors act with Lid and Sin3A to hyperactivate dhd. Using Cut\&Run chromatin profiling with a dedicated data analysis procedure, we found that dhd is intriguingly embedded in an H3K27me3/H3K9me3-enriched mini-domain flanked by DNA regulatory elements, including a dhd promoter-proximal element essential for its expression. Surprisingly, Lid, Sin3a, Snr1 and Mod(mdg4) impact H3K27me3 and this regulatory element in distinct manners. However, we show that these effectors activate dhd independently of H3K27me3/H3K9me3, and that dhd remains silent in the absence of these marks. Together, our study demonstrates an atypical and critical role for chromatin regulators Lid, Sin3A, Snr1 and Mod(mdg4) to trigger tissue-specific hyperactivation within a unique heterochromatin mini-domain.},

Mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference is used extensively as well. In the fly, exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses. However, the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or RNA interference is started. Targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Here we demonstrate that the auxin-inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in Drosophila melanogaster. Neither auxin nor TIR1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism, and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin-inducible degron.},

  abstract = {The polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRCs; PRC1 and PRC2) are conserved histone-modifying enzymes that often function cooperatively to repress gene expression. The PRCs are regulated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in complex ways. On the one hand, specific lncRNAs cause the PRCs to engage with chromatin and repress gene expression over genomic regions that can span megabases. On the other hand, the PRCs bind RNA with seemingly little sequence specificity, and at least in the case of PRC2, direct RNA-binding has the effect of inhibiting the enzyme. Thus, some RNAs appear to promote PRC activity, while others may inhibit it. The reasons behind this apparent dichotomy are unclear. The most potent PRC-activating lncRNAs associate with chromatin and are predominantly unspliced or harbor unusually long exons. Emerging data imply that these lncRNAs promote PRC activity through internal RNA sequence elements that arise and disappear rapidly in evolutionary time. These sequence elements may function by interacting with common subsets of RNA-binding proteins that recruit or stabilize PRCs on chromatin.

  abstract = {Transcriptional activation throughout the eukaryotic lineage has been tightly linked with disruption of nucleosome organization at promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions due to transcription factor binding. Regulatory DNA thus coincides with open or accessible genomic sites of remodeled chromatin. Current chromatin accessibility assays are used to separate the genome by enzymatic or chemical means and isolate either the accessible or protected locations. The isolated DNA is then quantified using a next-generation sequencing platform. Wide application of these assays has recently focused on the identification of the instrumental epigenetic changes responsible for differential gene expression, cell proliferation, functional diversification and disease development. Here we discuss the limitations and advantages of current genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays with especial attention on experimental precautions and sequence data analysis. We conclude with our perspective on future improvements necessary for moving the field of chromatin profiling forward.},

Although Ub-independent functions of PRC1 have also been suggested, it has remained unclear whether Ub-dependent and -independent functions of PRC1 operate differentially in a developmental context. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring1B, a core component of PRC1, is necessary for the temporary repression of key neuronal genes in neurogenic (early-stage) neural stem or progenitor cells (NPCs) but is dispensable for the persistent repression of these genes associated with the loss of neurogenic potential in astrogliogenic (late-stage) NPCs. Our results also suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity of the NuRD/MBD3 complex and Phc2-dependent PRC1 clustering are necessary for the transition from the Ub-dependent to -independent function of PRC1. Together, these results indicate that Ub-independent mode of repression by PRC1 plays a key role in mammalian development during cell fate restriction. Histone H2A ubiquitination (Ub)-dependent and -independent roles have been suggested for PRC1-Ring1. Tsuboi et al. show that PRC1 relies on Ub for transient silencing of poised neuronal genes in neurogenic neural stem/progenitor cells and persistently silences the same genes independently of Ub during neuronal fate restriction in mammalian development. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The ecdysone pathway was among the first experimental systems employed to study the impact of steroid hormones on the genome. In               Drosophila               and other insects, ecdysone coordinates developmental transitions, including wholesale transformation of the larva into the adult during metamorphosis. Like other hormones, ecdysone controls gene expression through a nuclear receptor, which functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Although it is clear that ecdysone elicits distinct transcriptional responses within its different target tissues, the role of its receptor, EcR, in regulating target gene expression is incompletely understood. In particular, EcR initiates a cascade of transcription factor expression in response to ecdysone, making it unclear which ecdysone-responsive genes are direct EcR targets. Here, we use the larval-to-prepupal transition of developing wings to examine the role of EcR in gene regulation. Genome-wide DNA binding profiles reveal that EcR exhibits widespread binding across the genome, including at many canonical ecdysone response genes. However, the majority of its binding sites reside at genes with wing-specific functions. We also find that EcR binding is temporally dynamic, with thousands of binding sites changing over time. RNA-seq reveals that EcR acts as both a temporal gate to block precocious entry to the next developmental stage as well as a temporal trigger to promote the subsequent program. Finally, transgenic reporter analysis indicates that EcR regulates not only temporal changes in target enhancer activity but also spatial patterns. Together, these studies define EcR as a multipurpose, direct regulator of gene expression, greatly expanding its role in coordinating developmental transitions.},

The field expanded upon the work initiated by Herman Muller in 1926 when he used X-rays to develop the first balancer chromosomes. Today, balancers are still invaluable to maintain mutations and transgenes but the arsenal of tools has expanded vastly and numerous new methods have been developed, many relying on the availability of the genome sequence and transposable elements. Forward genetic screens based on chemical mutagenesis or transposable elements have resulted in the unbiased identification of many novel players involved in processes probed by specific phenotypic assays. Reverse genetic approaches have relied on the availability of a carefully selected set of transposon insertions spread throughout the genome to allow the manipulation of the region in the vicinity of each insertion. Lastly, the ability to transform Drosophila with single copy transgenes using transposons or site-specific integration using the {$\Phi$}C31 integrase has allowed numerous manipulations, including the ability to create and integrate genomic rescue constructs, generate duplications, RNAi knock-out technology, binary expression systems like the GAL4/UAS system as well as other methods. Here, we will discuss the most useful methodologies to interrogate the fruit fly genome in vivo focusing on chemical mutagenesis, transposons and transgenes. Genome engineering approaches based on nucleases and RNAi technology are discussed in following chapters.},

YY1 has a well-established role in the development of the central nervous system, where it is involved in neurogenesis and maintenance of homeostasis in the developing brain. In neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease, the crucial role of YY1 in cellular processes in the central nervous system is further underscored. In this mini-review, we discuss the various mechanisms leading to the transcriptional activating and repressing roles of YY1, including its role as a traditional transcription factor, its interactions with cofactors and chromatin modifiers, the role of YY1 in the non-coding genome and 3D chromatin organization and the possible implications of the phase-separation mechanism on YY1 function. We provide examples on how these processes can be involved in normal development and how alterations can lead to various diseases.},

  abstract = {Abstract   The PRC2 complex is well known or producing H3K27me3, associated with silenced Polycomb target genes. However, the predominant activity of PRC2 produces H3K27me2 in an untargeted, genome-wide, hit-and-run mode that methylates 60\textendash 70\% of all histone H3. The level of H3K27me2 is correlated with low or absent transcriptional activity. Inactivation of PRC2 leads to loss of H3K27me2, global increase in H3K27ac and H3K4me1, and transcriptional activation. Transcriptional activity increases in proportion to the previous levels of H3K27me2 but even highly transcribed genes increase two- to fourfold. These effects indicate that PRC2 is a very dynamic, untargeted modifier of genomic chromatin that operates in constant antagonism with H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 monomethylation. This chapter reviews the evidence for a chromatin surveillance mechanism that restricts access to genomic DNA while allowing transient access to DNA binding proteins and the possibility of stable opening of gene regulatory regions. Functional and evolutionary relationships to PRC1 activities are examined.}

  abstract = {Polycomb mechanisms target the key genes controlling all the major differentiation pathways and cell fates. At the same time, they orchestrate the varieties of signals from other cells, from growth factors, morphogens, or external stimuli that condition a cell's response. Polycomb complexes generate two kinds of histone modifications: H2A ubiquitylation and H3K27 methylation, that are thought to serve instructive roles, controlling and targeting the repressive functions. The methylation function also serves as a memory of the previous state of a target gene and is responsible for the epigenetic features of Polycomb repression. Despite the vast amount learned about Polycomb complexes, two key features are still poorly understood: how they are recruited and how they effect repression. This review summarizes the basic features of these mechanisms and surveys current ideas of the role they play in guiding the trajectory from embryonic stem cells to terminally differentiated cells.}

Photobleaching experiments in living cells indicate that receptors transiently interact with DNA on the time scale of seconds and predict that the response elements may be sparsely occupied on average. Here, we show that the binding of one receptor at the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) does not reduce the steady-state binding of another receptor variant to the same GRE. Mathematical simulations reproduce this noncompetitive state using short GR/GRE residency times and relatively long times between DNA binding events. At many genomic sites where GR binding causes increased chromatin accessibility, concurrent steady-state binding levels for the variant receptor are actually increased, a phenomenon termed assisted loading. Temporally sparse transcription factor-DNA interactions induce local chromatin reorganization, resulting in transient access for binding of secondary regulatory factors.},

  abstract = {Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) is a transcriptional repressor in the Polycomb group (PcG), but its molecular role in PcG silencing is not known. Although SCM can interact with Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in vitro, biochemical studies have indicated that SCM is not a core constituent of PRC1 or PRC2. Nevertheless, SCM is just as critical for Drosophila Hox gene silencing as canonical subunits of these well-characterized PcG complexes. To address functional relationships between SCM and other PcG components, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation studies using cultured Drosophila Schneider line 2 (S2) cells and larval imaginal discs. We find that SCM associates with a Polycomb response element (PRE) upstream of the Ubx gene which also binds PRC1, PRC2, and the DNA-binding PcG protein Pleiohomeotic (PHO). However, SCM is retained at this Ubx PRE despite genetic disruption or knockdown of PHO, PRC1, or PRC2, suggesting that SCM chromatin targeting does not require prior association of these other PcG components. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (IPs) to test the consequences of SCM genetic disruption or knockdown revealed that PHO association is unaffected, but reduced levels of PRE-bound PRC2 and PRC1 were observed. We discuss these results in light of current models for recruitment of PcG complexes to chromatin targets.},

Here, we have generated a novel series of modular transgenic vectors designed to optimize and accelerate the production and analysis of transgenes in Drosophila. We constructed a novel vector backbone, pBID, that allows both phiC31 targeted transgene integration and incorporates insulator sequences to ensure specific and uniform transgene expression. Upon this framework, we have built a series of constructs that are either backwards compatible with existing restriction enzyme based vectors or utilize Gateway recombination technology for high-throughput cloning. These vectors allow for endogenous promoter or Gal4 targeted expression of transgenic proteins with or without fluorescent protein or epitope tags. In addition, we have generated constructs that facilitate transgenic splice isoform specific RNA inhibition of gene expression. We demonstrate the utility of these constructs to analyze proteins involved in nervous system development, physiology and neurodegenerative disease. We expect that these reagents will facilitate the proficiency and sophistication of Drosophila genetic analysis in both the nervous system and other tissues.},

Cells from neighboring compartments are characterized by distinct fates and functions and their continuous separation at compartment boundaries maintains proper tissue organization. Signaling across compartment boundaries can induce the local expression of morphogens that in turn direct growth and patterning of the surrounding cells. Compartment boundaries play therefore an important role in tissue development. Compartment boundaries were first identified in the early 1970s in the Drosophila wing. Here, we review the role of compartment boundaries in growth and patterning of the developing wing and then discuss the genetic and physical mechanisms underlying cell separation at compartment boundaries in this tissue.},

Transcription predicted the variation in active histone marks and complex chromatin states, like bivalent promoters, down to single-nucleosome resolution and at an accuracy that rivaled the correspondence between independent ChIP-seq experiments. Blocking transcription rapidly removed two punctate marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, from chromatin indicating that transcription is required for active histone modifications. Transcription was also required for maintenance of H3K27me3, consistent with a role for RNA in recruiting PRC2. A subset of DNase-I-hypersensitive sites were refractory to prediction, precluding models where transcription initiates pervasively at any open chromatin. Our results, in combination with past literature, support a model in which active histone modifications serve a supportive, rather than an essential regulatory, role in transcription.},

  abstract = {Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are known to cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. In addition, recent evidence suggests that ROS can also initiate signaling cascades that respond to stress and modify specific redox-sensitive moieties as a regulatory mechanism. This suggests that ROS are physiologically-relevant signaling molecules. However, these sensor/effector molecules are not uniformly distributed throughout the cell. Moreover, localized ROS damage may elicit site-specific compensatory measures. Thus, the impact of ROS can be likened to that of calcium, a ubiquitous second messenger, leading to the prediction that their effects are exquisitely dependent upon their location, quantity and even the timing of generation. Despite this prediction, ROS signaling is most commonly intuited through the global administration of chemicals that produce ROS or by ROS quenching through global application of antioxidants. Optogenetics, which uses light to control the activity of genetically-encoded effector proteins, provides a means of circumventing this limitation. Photo-inducible genetically-encoded ROS-generating proteins (RGPs) were originally employed for their phototoxic effects and cell ablation. However, reducing irradiance and/or fluence can achieve sub-lethal levels of ROS that may mediate subtle signaling effects. Hence, transgenic expression of RGPs as fusions to native proteins gives researchers a new tool to exert spatial and temporal control over ROS production. This review will focus on the new frontier defined by the experimental use of RGPs to study ROS signaling.,                                        \textbullet{}               ROS signaling is implicated in numerous cellular functions.                                         \textbullet{}               Genetically encoded proteins are capable light-induced ROS production.                                         \textbullet{}               Cell ablation, protein inactivation, and ROS signaling applications are described.},

Histone proteins represent crucial epigenetic components that~help specify cell identities.

In order to further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this striking phenomenon, two key questions must be answered: when and how old and new histones are differentially incorporated by sister chromatids, and how epigenetically distinct sister chromatids are specifically recognized and segregated. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular bases underlying these fundamental and important biological processes responsible for generating two distinct cells through one cell division.},

Discs respond to tissue damage in several ways: (a) Removal of part of the disc elicits localized cell proliferation and regeneration of the missing tissue. (b) Damage at specific locations in the disc can cause cells to generate disc-inappropriate structures (e.g., wing instead of leg), a phenomenon known as transdetermination. (c) Diffuse damage to imaginal discs, results in compensatory proliferation of surviving cells. Candidate-gene approaches have implicated the JNK, Wingless, and Hippo pathways in regeneration.

PCP is established through interactions of the core Frizzled (Fz)/PCP factors and, although their molecular interactions are beginning to be understood, the upstream input providing the directional bias and polarity axis remains unknown. Among core PCP genes, Fz is unique as it regulates PCP both cell-autonomously and non-autonomously, with its extracellular domain acting as a ligand for Van Gogh (Vang). We demonstrate in Drosophila melanogaster wings that Wg (Wingless) and dWnt4 (Drosophila Wnt homologue) provide instructive regulatory input for PCP axis determination, establishing polarity axes along their graded distribution and perpendicular to their expression domain borders. Loss-of-function studies reveal that Wg and dWnt4 act redundantly in PCP determination. They affect PCP by modulating the intercellular interaction between Fz and Vang, which is thought to be a key step in setting up initial polarity, thus providing directionality to the PCP process.},

More recent evidence suggests that a subset of PcG proteins engages in transcriptional activation in some cellular contexts, but how this property is exerted remains largely unknown. Here, we generated ES cells with single or combined disruption of polycomb group RING finger protein 3 (Pcgf3) and Pcgf5 with the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. We report that although these mutant cells maintained their self-renewal and colony-forming capacity, they displayed severe defects in mesoderm differentiation in vitro and in vivo Using RNA-seq to analyze transcriptional profiles of ES cells with single or combined Pcgf3/5 deficiencies, we found that in contrast to the canonical role of the related polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in gene repression, Pcgf3/5 mainly function as transcriptional activators driving expression of many genes involved in mesoderm differentiation. Proteomic approaches and promoter occupancy analyses helped to establish an extended Pcgf3/5 interactome and identified several novel Pcgf3/5 interactors. These included testis-expressed 10 (Tex10), which may directly contribute to transcriptional activation via the transcriptional co-activator p300. Furthermore, Pcgf3/5 deletion in ES cells substantially reduced the occupancy of Tex10 and p300 at target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that Pcgf3/5 are essential for regulating global levels of the histone modifier H2AK119ub1 in ES cells. Our findings establish Pcgf3/5 as transcriptional activators that interact with Tex10 and p300 in ES cells and point to redundant activity of Pcgf3/5 in pluripotency maintenance.}

However, little is known about the precise mechanisms of differently composed noncanonical PRC1 in the maintenance of the pluripotent cell state. Here we disrupt the Pcgf genes in mouse embryonic stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 and find Pcgf6 null embryonic stem cells display severe defects in self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, Pcgf6 regulates genes mostly involved in differentiation and spermatogenesis by assembling a noncanonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6. Notably, Pcgf6 deletion causes a dramatic decrease in PRC1.6 binding to target genes and no loss of H2AK119ub1. Thus, Pcgf6 is essential for recruitment of PRC1.6 to chromatin. Our results reveal a previously uncharacterized, H2AK119ub1-independent chromatin assembly associated with PRC1.6 complex.}

  abstract = {Animal genomes are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than two-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by ten-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between enhancer-promoter contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of enhancer-promoter biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries. It also offers a mechanism to reconcile apparently contradictory results from recent global TAD disruption with local TAD boundary deletion experiments. Together, these analyses advance our understanding of cis-regulatory contacts in controlling gene expression, and suggest new experimental directions.},

While non-malignant cells carrying cancer-predisposing BRCA1 mutations exhibit increased genomic instability, it remains unclear whether BRCA1 haploinsufficiency affects transcription and chromatin dynamics in breast epithelial cells. H3K27ac-associated super-enhancers were compared in primary breast epithelial cells from BRCA1 mutation carriers (BRCA1mut/+) and non-carriers (BRCA1+/+). Non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells with engineered BRCA1 haploinsufficiency were used to confirm the H3K27ac changes. The impact of BRCA1 mutations on enhancer function and enhancer-promoter looping was assessed in MCF10A cells. Here, we show that primary mammary epithelial cells from women with BRCA1 mutations display significant loss of H3K27ac-associated super-enhancers. These BRCA1-dependent super-enhancers are enriched with binding motifs for the GATA family. Non-tumorigenic BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells recapitulate the H3K27ac loss. Attenuated histone mark and enhancer activity in these BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells can be partially restored with wild-type BRCA1. Furthermore, chromatin conformation analysis demonstrates impaired enhancer-promoter looping in BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells. H3K27ac-associated super-enhancer loss is a previously unappreciated functional deficiency in ostensibly normal BRCA1 mutation-carrying breast epithelium. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into BRCA1 mutation-associated transcriptional and epigenetic abnormality in breast epithelial cells and tissue/cell lineage-specific tumorigenesis.}

Here, we describe two individuals, each with rare de novo missense variants in RNF2. Their phenotypes include intrauterine growth retardation, severe intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, seizures, feeding difficulties and dysmorphic features. Population genomics data suggest that RNF2 is highly constrained for loss-of-function (LoF) and missense variants, and both p.R70H and p.S82R variants have not been reported to date. Structural analyses of the two alleles indicate that these changes likely impact the interaction between RNF2 and BMI1, another PRC1 subunit, or its substrate Histone H2A, respectively. Finally, we provide functional data in Drosophila that these two missense variants behave as LoF alleles in vivo. The evidence provide support for deleterious alleles in RNF2 being associated with a new and recognizable genetic disorder. This tentative gene-disease association in addition to the 12 previously identified disorders caused by PcG genes attests to the importance of these chromatin regulators in Mendelian disorders.}

This antagonistic activity is important for body patterning during embryonic development, but whether this function module has a role in adult tissues is unclear. Here we report that in the Drosophila ovary, disruption of the Polycomb responsive complex 1 (PRC1) specifically in the supporting escort cells causes blockage of cystoblast differentiation and germline stem cell- like tumor formation. The tumor is caused by derepression of decapentaplegic ( dpp ) which prevents cystoblast differentiation. Interestingly, activation of dpp in escort cells requires the function of TrxG gene brahma ( brm ), suggesting that loss of PRC1 in escort cells causes Brm-dependent dpp expression. Our study suggests a requirement for balanced activity between PcG and TrxG in an adult stem cell niche, and disruption of this balance could lead to the loss of tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis.}

Research in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that specialized Polycomb response elements (PREs) are key for targeting of Drosophila Polycomb complexes. PREs are necessary and sufficient to recruit all Polycomb complexes but they also recruit proteins that counteract Polycomb repression in cells where target genes have to remain active. The ability to simultaneously recruit repressors and antirepressors makes PREs switchable cellular memory modules. PREs comprise flexible combinations of recognition sequences for multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Polycomb complexes cannot bind DNA on their own so these adaptor proteins mediate the recruitment. Most of the PRE-bound adaptor proteins interact with Polycomb complexes weakly. However, their individually weak interactions combine to produce robust recruitment. Such combinatorial recruitment is key for the epigenetic property of the Polycomb system to repress target genes only if they have been repressed during previous cell cycles.}

Most of the existing methods for GRN inference rely on gene co-expression analysis or TF-target binding information, where the determination of co-expression is often unreliable merely based on gene expression levels, and the TF-target binding data from high-throughput experiments may be noisy, leading to a high ratio of false links and missed links, especially for large-scale networks. In recent years, the microscopy images recording spatial gene expression have become a new resource in GRN reconstruction, as the spatial and temporal expression patterns contain much abundant gene interaction information. Till now, the spatial expression resources have been largely underexploited, and only a few traditional image processing methods have been employed in the image-based GRN reconstruction. Moreover, co-expression analysis using conventional measurements based on image similarity may be inaccurate, because it is the local-pattern consistency rather than global-image-similarity that determines gene-gene interactions. Here we present GripDL (Gene regulatory interaction prediction via Deep Learning), which incorporates high-confidence TF-gene regulation knowledge from previous studies, and constructs GRNs for Drosophila eye development based on Drosophila embryonic gene expression images. Benefitting from the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and the supervision information of known interactions, the new method outperforms traditional methods with a large margin and reveals new intriguing knowledge about Drosophila eye development.},

Interestingly, this region of L3mbtl2 harbors the evolutionarily conserved Pho-binding pocketalso present in  Drosophila  Sfmbt, and mutation of the critical residues within this pocket completely abolishes its interaction with target promoters. Additionally, decreased PRC1.6 chromatin occupancy was observed following loss of individual components (L3mbtl2, Pcgf6, and Max) of the complex. Our findings suggest that the recruitment of noncanonical PRC1.6 complex in ESCs might be the result of L3mbtl2's interaction with multiple components of the complex.}

We observed that mutations in the genes encoding the physically interacting synaptic proteins UNC-13 and syntaxin/UNC-64 failed to complement one another in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Noncomplementation was not observed between null alleles of these genes and thus this genetic interaction does not occur with a simple decrease in dosage at the two loci. However, noncomplementation was observed if at least one gene encoded a partially functional gene product. Thus, this genetic interaction requires a poisonous gene product to sensitize the genetic background. Nonallelic noncomplementation was not limited to interacting proteins: Although the strongest effects were observed between loci encoding gene products that bind to one another, interactions were also observed between proteins that do not directly interact but are members of the same complex. We also observed noncomplementation between genes that function at distant points in the same pathway, implying that physical interactions are not required for nonallelic noncomplementation. Finally, we observed that mutations in genes that function in different processes such as neurotransmitter synthesis or synaptic development complement one another. Thus, this genetic interaction is specific for genes acting in the same pathway, that is, for genes acting in synaptic vesicle trafficking.},

However, the prevalence of these two mechanisms is unknown, especially in plants as H2AK121ub marks were examined at only a handful of Polycomb group targets. By using genome-wide analyses, we show that H2AK121ub marks are surprisingly widespread in Arabidopsis thaliana, often co-localizing with H3K27me3 but also occupying a set of transcriptionally active genes devoid of H3K27me3. Furthermore, by profiling H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks in atbmi1a/b/c, clf/swn, and lhp1 mutants we found that PRC2 activity is not required for H2AK121ub marking at most genes. In contrast, loss of AtBMI1 function impacts the incorporation of H3K27me3 marks at most Polycomb group targets. Our findings show the relationship between H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks across the A. thaliana genome and unveil that ubiquitination by PRC1 is largely independent of PRC2 activity in plants, while the inverse is true for H3K27 trimethylation.}

  abstract = {Artificial regulation of gene expression through RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated epigenome editing is one the most important and attractive next-generation technologies for plant trait improvement, often called ``new plant breeding techniques'' (NPBTs). RdDM can induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of a target gene via modification of the cytosine methylation levels of its promoter region; thus, RdDM is useful as a method for suppression of gene expression without changing the genomic DNA sequence. Likewise, several types of strict epigenetic regulation occur at both the DNA and chromatin levels under normal growth conditions in plants. Recent studies have revealed genome-wide and organ-specific landscapes of epigenetic modifications and their close relationship to plant growth regulation. Therefore, understanding recent findings concerning epigenetic regulation in plants is very important to the future application of epigenome editing in plant breeding. In this chapter, we illustrate several aspects of theoretical and applied epigenetics in plants through discussion of recent studies.}

  abstract = {The piggyBac transposon was originally isolated from the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni, in the 1980s. Despite its early discovery and dissimilarity to the other DNA transposon families, the piggyBac transposon was not recognized as a member of a large transposon superfamily for a long time. Initially, the piggyBac transposon was thought to be a rare transposon. This view, however, has now been completely revised as a number of fully sequenced genomes have revealed the presence of piggyBac-like repetitive elements. The isolation of active copies of the piggyBac-like elements from several distinct species further supported this revision. This includes the first isolation of an active mammalian DNA transposon identified in the bat genome. To date, the piggyBac transposon has been deeply characterized and it represents a number of unique characteristics. In general, all members of the piggyBac superfamily use TTAA as their integration target sites. In addition, the piggyBac transposon shows precise excision, i.e., restoring the sequence to its preintegration state, and can transpose in a variety of organisms such as yeasts, malaria parasites, insects, mammals, and even in plants. Biochemical analysis of the chemical steps of transposition revealed that piggyBac does not require DNA synthesis during the actual transposition event. The broad host range has attracted researchers from many different fields, and the piggyBac transposon is currently the most widely used transposon system for genetic manipulations.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila wing primordium is defined by expression of the selector gene vestigial (vg) in a discrete subpopulation of cells within the wing imaginal disc. Following the early segregation of the disc into dorsal (D) and ventral (V) compartments, vg expression is governed by signals generated along the boundary between the two compartments. Short-range DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2)-Notch signaling between D and V cells drives vg expression in `border' cells that flank the boundary. It also induces these same cells to secrete the long-range morphogen Wingless(Wg), which drives vg expression in surrounding cells up to 25-30 cell diameters away. Here, we show that Wg signaling is not sufficient to activate vg expression away from the D-V boundary. Instead, Wg must act in combination with a short-range signal produced by cells that already express vg. We present evidence that this vg-dependent, vg-inducing signal feeds forward from one cell to the next to entrain surrounding cells to join the growing wing primordium in response to Wg. We propose that Wg promotes the expansion of the wing primordium following the D-V segregation by fueling this non-autonomous autoregulatory mechanism.},

  abstract = {Development of the Drosophila wing\textemdash a paradigm of organ development\textemdash is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp ``equalized'' by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding ``pre-wing'' cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of vestigial (vg)\textemdash the selector gene that specifies the wing state\textemdash both to sustain vg expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce vg expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.},

Tumor cells from ccRCC patients with               VHL               loss-of-function mutations usually had increased abundance and nuclear localization of ZHX2.

Advanced 3D genome-mapping methods that combine proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing (such as chromosome conformation capture, Hi-C)2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques (such as chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing, ChIA-PET)3, have revealed topologically associating domains4 with frequent chromatin contacts, and have identified chromatin loops mediated by specific protein factors for insulation and regulation of transcription5\textendash 7. However, these methods rely on pairwise proximity ligation and reflect population-level views, and thus cannot reveal the detailed nature of chromatin interactions. Although single-cell Hi-C8 potentially overcomes this issue, this method may be limited by the sparsity of data that is inherent to current single-cell assays. Recent advances in microfluidics have opened opportunities for droplet-based genomic analysis9 but this approach has not yet been adapted for chromatin interaction analysis. Here we describe a strategy for multiplex chromatin-interaction analysis via droplet-based and barcode-linked sequencing, which we name ChIA-Drop. We demonstrate the robustness of ChIA-Drop in capturing complex chromatin interactions with single-molecule precision, which has not been possible using methods based on population-level pairwise contacts. By applying ChIA-Drop to Drosophila cells, we show that chromatin topological structures predominantly consist of multiplex chromatin interactions with high heterogeneity; ChIA-Drop also reveals promoter-centred multivalent interactions, which provide topological insights into transcription.},

  abstract = {Enhancers integrate positive and negative regulatory information to direct localized patterns of gene expression in the Drosophila embryo. Here we present evidence for the occurrence of cis regulatory elements that control the levels of gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions. For this purpose we have investigated the Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) because genetic studies suggest that the BX-C contains as much as 300 kb of cis regulatory information. A specialized DNA element, Fab-7, has been proposed to function as a boundary element that separates the iab-6 and iab-7 cis regulatory regions within the Abd-B domain of the BX-C. A 1.2-kb Fab-7 DNA fragment was placed between divergently transcribed white and lacZ test promoters and challenged with several defined enhancers expressed in the early embryo. These studies suggest that Fab-7 functions as an attenuator, which weakens gene expression by reducing enhancer-promoter interactions. Fab-7 selectively blocks distal enhancers in an orientation-independent fashion, and can function when located far from either the distal enhancer or target promoter. Fab-7 may be related to insulator DNAs, which flank genetic loci and functionally isolate neighboring genes. We propose that specialized DNA elements, such as the Fab-7 attenuator, might play a general role in controlling the levels of gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions.},

H2AK119ub1 (H2Aub) and H3K27me3 are catalyzed by Polycomb-repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) respectively, and they largely overlap in the genome due to mutual recruitment of the two complexes. However, it is unclear whether PRC1/H2Aub and PRC2/H3K27me3 can also function independently. By developing an ultra-sensitive carrier-DNA-assisted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing method termed CATCH-Seq, we generated allelic H2Aub profiles in mouse gametes and early embryos. Our results revealed an unexpected genomewide decoupling of H2Aub and H3K27me3 in mouse preimplantation embryos, where H2Aub but not H3K27me3 was enriched at PcG targets while only H3K27me3 was deposited in the broad distal domains associated with DNA methylation-independent non-canonical imprinting. These observations suggest that H2Aub represses future bivalent genes during early embryogenesis without H3K27me3, but it is not required for the maintenance of non-canonical imprinting, which is mediated by maternal H3K27me3. Thus, our study reveals the distinct depositions and independent functions of H2Aub and H3K27me3 during early mammalian development.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins function as vital epigenetic regulators in various biological processes, including pluripotency, development, and carcinogenesis. PcG proteins form multicomponent complexes, and two major types of protein complexes have been identified in mammals to date, Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). The PRC1 complexes are composed in a hierarchical manner in which the catalytic core, RING1A/B, exclusively interacts with one of six Polycomb group RING finger (PCGF) proteins. This association with specific PCGF proteins allows for PRC1 to be subdivided into six distinct groups, each with their own unique modes of action arising from the distinct set of associated proteins. Historically, PRC1 was considered to be a transcription repressor that deposited monoubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and compacted local chromatin. More recently, there is increasing evidence that demonstrates the transcription activation role of PRC1. Moreover, studies on the higher-order chromatin structure have revealed a new function for PRC1 in mediating long-range interactions. This provides a different perspective regarding both the transcription activation and repression characteristics of PRC1. This review summarizes new advancements regarding the composition of mammalian PRC1 and accompanying explanations of how diverse PRC1-associated proteins participate in distinct transcription regulation mechanisms.}

Histone H2AK119 ubiquitination (H2Aub) is a prevalent modification and has been primarily linked to gene silencing. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here we report the identification of RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1), a subunit of the RSF complex, as a H2Aub binding protein, which mediates the gene-silencing function of this histone modification. RSF1 associates specifically with H2Aub, but not H2Bub nucleosomes, through a previously uncharacterized and obligatory region designated as ubiquitinated H2A binding domain. In human and mouse cells, genes regulated by RSF1 overlap significantly with those controlled by RNF2/Ring1B, the subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) which catalyzes the ubiquitination of H2AK119. About 82\% of H2Aub-enriched genes, including the classic PRC1 target Hox genes, are bound by RSF1 around their transcription start sites. Depletion of H2Aub levels by Ring1B knockout results in a significant reduction of RSF1 binding. In contrast, RSF1 knockout does not affect RNF2/Ring1B or H2Aub levels but leads to derepression of H2Aub target genes, accompanied by changes in H2Aub chromatin organization and release of linker histone H1. The action of RSF1 in H2Aub-mediated gene silencing is further demonstrated by chromatin-based in vitro transcription. Finally, RSF1 and Ring1 act cooperatively to regulate mesodermal cell specification and gastrulation during Xenopus early embryonic development. Taken together, these data identify RSF1 as a H2Aub reader that contributes to H2Aub-mediated gene silencing by maintaining a stable nucleosome pattern at promoter regions.}

  abstract = {For more than 100 years, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has served as a powerful model organism for biological and biomedical research due to its many genetic and physiological similarities to humans and the availability of sophisticated technologies used to manipulate its genome and genes. The Drosophila research community quickly adopted CRISPR technologies and, in the 8 years since the first clustered~regularly~interspaced~short~palindromic~repeats (CRISPR) publications in flies, has explored and innovated methods for mutagenesis, precise genome engineering, and beyond. Moreover, the short lifespan and ease of genetics have made Drosophila an ideal testing ground for in vivo applications and refinements of the rapidly evolving set of CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) tools. Here, we review innovations in delivery of CRISPR reagents, increased efficiency of cutting and homology-directed repair (HDR), and alternatives to standard Cas9-based approaches. While the focus is primarily on in vivo systems, we also describe the role of Drosophila cultured cells as both an indispensable first step in the process of assessing new CRISPR technologies and a platform for genome-wide CRISPR pooled screens.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Context  Regenerative medicine has recently presented a revolutionary solution to end-stage kidney disease. Reprogramming patients' own cells generates induced pluripotent stem cells that are subsequently differentiated to ``kidney organoid,'' a structure that is anatomically and functionally similar to the kidney. This approach holds the promise of a transplantable, immunocompetent, and functional kidney that could be produced in vitro. However, caution must be taken due to the molecular-level similarities between induced pluripotent stem cells and renal cell carcinomas. As such, if cell reprogramming is not tightly controlled, it can lead to carcinogenic changes.    Objective  Based on recent next-generation sequencing results and other supporting data, we identified three major molecular attributes of renal cell carcinoma: metabolic alterations, epigenetic changes, and miRNA-based alterations. Strikingly, these variations are mirrored in induced pluripotent stem cells, which are the main cell source of renal regenerative medicine. Our objective was to discuss the shared metabolic, epigenetic and miRNA-regulated characteristics and to abridge their significance in renal regenerative medicine.    Evidence acquisition  English-language literature was retrieved through PubMed.    Evidence synthesis  Authors collected the published evidence and evaluated the content based on independent literature findings. Articles were filtered to include only highly relevant, recent publications that presented reproducible results by authorities of the field.    Conclusions  The kidney represents a unique metabolic environment that could be hijacked by induced pluripotent stem cells or by partially differentiated cells for oncogenic transformation. Future differentiation protocols must produce kidney organoids that are fully engaged in filtration function.    Patient summary  A new technology can produce mini-kidneys or kidney organoids. This review discusses some of the challenges this technology has to face, including its high oncogenic potential. Understanding these similarities will lead to the safe creation of new functional kidney units in patients with kidney failure.}
