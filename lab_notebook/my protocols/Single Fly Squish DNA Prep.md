# Prepare Squishing Buffer

| Reagent               | Volume | Final Conc. | 50 uL    | x3.5       |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| dH2O                  | 965 uL |             | 48.25 uL | 168.875 uL |
| 1M Tris-Cl pH 8.0     | 10 uL  | 10 mM       | 0.5 uL   | 1.75 uL    |
| 100 mM EDTA           | 10 uL  | 1 mM        | 0.5 uL   | 1.75 uL    |
| 5M NaCl               | 5 uL   | 25 mM       | 0.25 uL  | 0.875 uL   |
| 20 mg/mL proteinase K | 10 uL  | 0.2 mg/mL   | 0.5 uL   | 1.75 uL    |

# Procedure:  

1. Make fresh SB (recipe above). Adjust volume accordingly: you will need 50ul per fly.  
2. Knock out flies and transfer a single adult of the desired genotype into an empty 1.5ml tube.  
3. Put the tube on ice for a few minutes to knock out the fly.  
4. Aspirate 50ul of SB into a 200ul pipet tip.  
5. Squish the fly using the pipet tip, without expelling the 50ul of SB (some of the SB will be drawn out of the tip).  
6. Expel the remainder of the SB, and mix.  
7. Incubate at room temp for 30 min.  
8. Incubate at 95°C for 5 min. (85C for 10 min for larger, ~5kb, products)  
9. Ice, then spin down at max speed for 5 min.

> Single-fly genomic DNA preps should be stored at 4°C for up to a few months.  
> For genotyping, use 2.5ul of this genomic DNA prep as template for a 25ul PCR
