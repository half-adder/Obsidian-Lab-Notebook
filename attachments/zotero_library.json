Accordingly, PRC1 ligase function has been the subject of recent biochemical and structural studies. The E3 activity resides in a heterodimer of Really interesting new gene (RING) domains. One of these RINGs is present at the N-terminus of the Ring1 subunit and is the catalytically active, E2-binding RING. The second, “inactive” RING is present in the N-terminus of one of six (in human) Polycomb group (PcG) RING Finger (PCGF)-family subunits. The PCGF RING both stabilizes the active RING and influences nucleosome substrate binding and activity of the heterodimer. While biochemical aspects of ligase function are now reasonably clear, much ongoing work is focused on understanding which of the PRC1 variants (canonical or noncanonical) is most important in introducing this mark to target loci and on better defining the biological function of H2A ubiquitination.","author":[{"literal":"A.G.

One of the most important targets of the regulatory ubiquitination are histones. Localization of ubiquitin residue in different regions of the nucleosome attracts a strictly determined set of cellular factors with varied functionality. Depending on the type of histone and the particular lysine residue undergoing modification, histone ubiquitination can lead both to transcription activation and to gene repression, as well as contribute to DNA repair via different mechanisms. An extremely interesting feature of the family of RING E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyzing histone ubiquitination is the striking structural diversity of the domains providing high specificity of modification very similar initial targets. It is obvious that further elucidation of peculiarities of the ubiquitination system involved in histone modification, as well as understanding of physiological role of this process in the maintenance of homeostasis of both single cells and the entire organism, will substantially expand the possibilities of treating a number of socially significant diseases.","author":[{"literal":"A.

  {"id":"ahmad2019","abstract":"Patterned expression of many developmental genes is specified by transcription factor gene expression, but is thought to be refined by chromatin-mediated repression. Regulatory DNA sequences called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are required to repress some developmental target genes, and are widespread in genomes, suggesting that they broadly affect developmental programs. While PREs in transgenes can nucleate trimethylation on lysine 27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3), none have been demonstrated to be necessary at endogenous chromatin domains. This failure is thought to be due to the fact that most endogenous H3K27me3 domains contain many PREs, and individual PREs may be redundant. In contrast to these ideas, we show here that PREs near the wing selector gene vestigial have distinctive roles at their endogenous locus, even though both PREs are repressors in transgenes. First, a PRE near the promoter is required for vestigial activation and not for repression. Second, only the distal PRE contributes to H3K27me3, but even removal of both PREs does not eliminate H3K27me3 across the vestigial domain. Thus, endogenous chromatin domains appear to be intrinsically marked by H3K27me3, and PREs appear required to enhance this chromatin modification to high levels at inactive genes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Kami"},{"family":"Spens","given":"Amy E."}],"citation-key":"ahmad2019","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1007877","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e1007877","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Separate Polycomb Response Elements control chromatin state and activation of the vestigial gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007877","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"ahmad2021","abstract":"Development proceeds by the activation of genes by transcription factors and the inactivation of others by chromatin-mediated gene silencing. In certain cases development can be reversed or redirected by mis-expression of master regulator transcription factors. This must involve the activation of previously silenced genes, and such developmental aberrations are thought to underlie a variety of cancers. Here, we express the wing-specific Vestigial master regulator to reprogram the developing eye, and test the role of silencing in reprogramming using an H3.3K27M oncohistone mutation that dominantly inhibits histone H3K27 trimethylation. We find that production of the oncohistone blocks eye-to-wing reprogramming. CUT&Tag chromatin profiling of mutant tissues shows that H3K27me3 of domains is generally reduced upon oncohistone production, suggesting that a previous developmental program must be silenced for effective transformation. Strikingly, Vg and H3.3K27M synergize to stimulate overgrowth of eye tissue, a phenotype that resembles that of mutations in Polycomb silencing components. Transcriptome profiling of elongating RNA Polymerase II implicates the mis-regulation of signaling factors in overgrowth. Our results demonstrate that growth dysregulation can result from the simple combination of crippled silencing and transcription factor mis-expression, an effect that may explain the origins of oncohistone-bearing cancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Kami"},{"family":"Henikoff","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"ahmad2021","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009225","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e1009225","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The H3.3K27M oncohistone antagonizes reprogramming in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009225","volume":"17"},

These interactions are especially important in development as gene expression programs change. Chromatin generally limits the accessibility of DNA, and thus exposing sequences at regulatory elements is critical for gene expression. However, it is challenging to understand how transcription factors manipulate chromatin structure and the sequence of regulatory events. The Drosophila embryo has provided a powerful setting to directly observe the establishment and elaboration of chromatin features and experimentally test the causality of transcriptional events that are shared among many metazoans. The large embryo is tractable by live imaging, and a variety of well-developed tools allow the manipulation of factors during early development. The early embryo develops as a syncytium with rapid nuclear divisions and no zygotic transcription, with largely featureless chromatin. Thus, studies in this system have revealed the progression of genome activation triggered by pioneer factors that initiate DNA exposure at regulatory elements and the establishment of chromatin domains, including heterochromatin, the nucleolus, and nuclear bodies. The de novo emergence of nuclear structures in the early embryo reveals features of chromatin dynamics that are likely to be central to transcriptional regulation in all cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Kami"},{"family":"Henikoff","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"ahmad2022","container-title":"Faculty Reviews","container-title-short":"Fac Rev","DOI":"10.12703/r/11-40","ISSN":"2732-432X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"page":"40","PMCID":"PMC9816875","PMID":"36644296","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Drosophila embryo as a tabula rasa for the epigenome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9816875/","volume":"11"},

Di- and trimethylation marks are diluted twofold upon DNA replication, as a consequence of new histone deposition. Importantly, within one cell cycle, all PTMs are restored. In general, new histones are modified to mirror the parental histones. However, H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3 are propagated by continuous modification of parental and new histones because the establishment of these marks extends over several cell generations.

The spacer region of Pho, separated from the DNA-binding domain by a long flexible linker, forms a tight complex with the four malignant brain tumor (4MBT) domain of Sfmbt. The highly conserved spacer region of the human Pho ortholog YY1 binds three of the four human 4MBT domain proteins in an analogous manner but with lower affinity. Comparison of the Drosophila Pho:Sfmbt and human YY1:MBTD1 complex structures provides a molecular explanation for the lower affinity of YY1 for human 4MBT domain proteins. Structure-guided mutations that disrupt the interaction between Pho and Sfmbt abolish formation of a ternary Sfmbt:Pho:DNA complex in vitro and repression of developmental regulator genes in Drosophila. PRE tethering of Sfmbt by Pho is therefore essential for Polycomb repression in Drosophila.

  {"id":"andreapiunti2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND  Multicellular organisms depend on the precise orchestration of gene expression to direct embryonic development and to maintain tissue homeostasis through their life spans. Exactly how such cell type–specific patterns of gene expression are established, maintained, and passed on to the next generation is one of the most fundamental questions of biology. Eukaryotes package their DNA into nucleosomes to form chromatin fibers. Chromatin plays a central role in regulating accessibility to DNA in many different DNA templated processes, including machineries that transcribe DNA into RNA, i.e., transcription. Transcriptional control through sequence-specific DNA binding factors (transcription factors) is well established; however, proteins that change chromatin structure (chromatin modifiers and remodelers) provide an additional layer of regulation and are considered major epigenetic determinants of cell identity and function. Among the numerous chromatin modifiers, the members of the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, in particular, have been scrutinized genetically and biochemically for decades. However, new and unexpected functions for these complexes are constantly emerging because of the intense interest in the critical role these proteins play in maintaining a balanced state of gene expression.  ADVANCES  In the classical view, PcG and TrxG proteins regulate the repressed and activated states of gene expression, respectively. Both PcG and TrxG are organized in multiprotein complexes, which include the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2, respectively), and the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family. Polycomb and COMPASS families are well known for their opposing roles in balancing gene expression, a phenomenon initially characterized using classical  Drosophila melanogaster  genetic approaches at a time when their biochemical functions were still unknown. Later studies demonstrated that Polycomb and COMPASS complexes have enzymatic activities modifying different sites on a common target, the nucleosome. Nucleosomes can be posttranslationally modified in a variety of ways, many of which strongly correlate with different states of gene expression. Through their ability to regulate gene expression, several components of both the Polycomb and COMPASS complexes are involved in a plethora of crucial biological processes ranging from the regulation of embryonic development to widespread involvement in neoplastic pathogenesis.   OUTLOOK  Recent genome-wide studies have demonstrated that a large number of the components of the Polycomb and COMPASS families are often mutated in different forms of cancer. Some mutations result in gene deletion or early termination, such as loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, whereas gain-of-function (GOF) mutations increase or change their normal activities. Although it cannot be excluded that some of those are passenger rather than driver mutations, they suggest a relevant function of these proteins in tumorigenesis. Moreover, animal models have provided convincing evidence supporting a role for these complexes in tumor progression. However, even after decades of study, how Polycomb and COMPASS control normal or aberrant gene regulatory networks is not fully understood yet. From the perspective of their catalytic activities, the degree to which catalytic versus noncatalytic functions contribute to their roles in development and cancer has just begun to emerge. Concurrently, the possibility that PcG and TrxG enzymatic activities modify non-nucleosome substrates remains a fascinating, although largely unexplored, hypothesis. Ongoing efforts to decipher how mutations affecting members of these complexes disturb transcriptional balances and promote oncogenesis could provide critically needed new strategies for cancer therapeutics.","author":[{"literal":"Andrea Piunti"},{"literal":"Ali Shilatifard"}],"citation-key":"andreapiunti2016","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aad9780","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"title":"Epigenetic balance of gene expression by Polycomb and COMPASS families.","type":"article-journal"},

Later, a group of diverse genes collectively called Polycomb group (PcG) genes were identified based on common mutant phenotypes. PcG proteins, which are well-conserved in animals, were originally characterized as negative regulators of gene transcription during development and subsequently shown to function in various biological processes; their deregulation is associated with diverse phenotypes in development and in disease, especially cancer. PcG proteins function on chromatin and can form two distinct complexes with different enzymatic activities: Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is a histone ubiquitin ligase and PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase. Recent studies have revealed the existence of various mutually exclusive PRC1 and PRC2 variants. In this Review, we discuss new concepts concerning the biochemical and molecular functions of these new PcG complex variants, and how their epigenetic activities are involved in mammalian development and cancer.

PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1–PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes.

Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1).

  {"id":"anthonysanchez2016","abstract":"BMI1 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a key role in maintaining epigenetic silencing during development. BMI1 also participates in gene silencing during DNA damage response, but the precise downstream function of BMI1 in gene silencing is unclear. Here we identified the UBR5 E3 ligase as a downstream factor of BMI1. We found that UBR5 forms damage-inducible nuclear foci in a manner dependent on the PRC1 components BMI1, RNF1 (RING1a), and RNF2 (RING1b). Whereas transcription is repressed at UV-induced lesions on chromatin, depletion of the PRC1 members or UBR5 alone derepressed transcription elongation at these sites, suggesting that UBR5 functions in a linear pathway with PRC1 in inducing gene silencing at lesions. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that UBR5 associates with BMI1 as well as FACT components SPT16 and SSRP1. We found that UBR5 localizes to the UV-induced lesions along with SPT16. We show that UBR5 ubiquitinates SPT16, and depletion of UBR5 or BMI1 leads to an enlargement of SPT16 foci size at UV lesions, suggesting that UBR5 and BMI1 repress SPT16 enrichment at the damaged sites. Consistently, depletion of the FACT components effectively reversed the transcriptional derepression incurred in the UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells. Finally, UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells are hypersensitive to UV, which supports the notion that faulty RNA synthesis at damaged sites is harmful to the cell fitness. Altogether, these results suggest that BMI1 and UBR5 repress the polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription at damaged sites, by negatively regulating the FACT-dependent Pol II elongation.","author":[{"literal":"Anthony Sanchez"},{"literal":"Angelo de Vivo"},{"literal":"Nadima Uprety"},{"literal":"Jonghwan Kim"},{"literal":"Stanley M.

BRM was identified as a transcriptional activator of Hox genes required for the specification of body segment identities. To clarify the role of the BRM complex in the transcription of other genes, we examined its distribution on larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The BRM complex is associated with nearly all transcriptionally active chromatin in a pattern that is generally non-overlapping with that of Polycomb, a repressor of Hox gene transcription. Reduction of BRM function dramatically reduces the association of RNA polymerase II with salivary gland chromosomes. A few genes, such as induced heat shock loci, are not associated with the BRM complex; transcription of these genes is not compromised by loss of BRM function. The distribution of the BRM complex thus correlates with a dependence on BRM for gene activity.

We found that H3K4me1 exhibits either a bimodal pattern at active promoters, where it flanks H3K4me3, or a unimodal pattern at poised promoters, where it coincides with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. This pattern is correlated with gene expression level, but is more strongly linked to a poised chromatin state, defined by the simultaneous presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, than to transcriptional activity. The pattern is especially prominent in germ cells, but is also present in other cell types, including embryonic stem cells and differentiated somatic cells.

To understand why some sequences evolve faster than others in a single cis-regulatory locus, we investigated function and evolutionary dynamics of the promoter of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-47 gene.

The distal promoter displays little if any conservation between several closely related nematodes. Despite this divergence, sequences from all species confer robustness of expression, arguing that this function does not require substantial sequence conservation. We showed that even unrelated sequences have the ability to promote robust expression.

  {"id":"baudat2010","abstract":"Homing in on Hotspots\nThe clustering of recombination in the genome, around locations known as hotspots, is associated with specific DNA motifs. Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by Cheung et al.). Parvanov et al. (p. 835, published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas Myers et al. (p. 876, published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome. Baudat et al. (p. 836, published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species.\nMeiotic recombination events cluster into narrow segments of the genome, defined as hotspots. Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome.\nA chromatin-modifying enzyme is implicated in the determination of recombination loci within the genome.\nA chromatin-modifying enzyme is implicated in the determination of recombination loci within the genome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Baudat","given":"F."},{"family":"Buard","given":"J."},{"family":"Grey","given":"C."},{"family":"Fledel-Alon","given":"A."},{"family":"Ober","given":"C."},{"family":"Przeworski","given":"M."},{"family":"Coop","given":"G."},{"family":"Massy","given":"B.","dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"baudat2010","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10/chmjx8","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5967","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,12]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2010, American Association for the Advancement of Science","page":"836-840","PMID":"20044539","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"PRDM9 Is a Major Determinant of Meiotic Recombination Hotspots in Humans and Mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5967/836","volume":"327"},

However, the RNAs that bind PRC2 in cells, the subunits that mediate these interactions, and the role of RNA in PRC2 recruitment to chromatin all remain unclear. By performing iCLIP for PRC2 in comparison with other RNA binding proteins, we show here that PRC2 binds nascent RNA at essentially all active genes. Although interacting with RNA promiscuously, PRC2 binding is enriched at specific locations within RNAs, primarily exon–intron boundaries and the 3′ UTR. Deletion of other PRC2 subunits reveals that SUZ12 is sufficient to establish this RNA binding profile. Contrary to prevailing models, we also demonstrate that the interaction of PRC2 with RNA or chromatin is mutually antagonistic in cells and in vitro. RNA degradation in cells triggers PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands at active genes. Correspondingly, the release of PRC2 from chromatin in cells increases RNA binding. Consistent with this, RNA and nucleosomes compete for PRC2 binding in vitro.

However, studying the enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

We then show that by encoding such signals into a single input, expression mean and variability can be independently tuned. Further, we construct a light-responsive promoter library and demonstrate how pulsatile signaling also enables graded multi-gene regulation at fixed expression ratios, despite differences in promoter dose-response characteristics. Pulsatile regulation can thus lead to beneficial functional behaviors in synthetic biological systems, which previously required laborious optimization of genetic parts or the construction of synthetic gene networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Benzinger","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Khammash","given":"Mustafa"}],"citation-key":"benzinger2018","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-05882-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,30]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cellular noise;Gene expression;Optogenetics;Synthetic biology\nSubject_term_id: cellular-noise;gene-expression;optogenetics;synthetic-biology","number":"1","page":"3521","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Pulsatile inputs achieve tunable attenuation of gene expression variability and graded multi-gene regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05882-2","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"berry2017","abstract":"Genes targeted by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are regulated in cis by chromatin modifications and also in trans by diffusible regulators such as transcription factors. Here, we introduce a mathematical model in which transcription directly antagonizes Polycomb silencing, thereby linking these cis- and trans-regulatory inputs to gene expression. The model is parameterized by recent experimental data showing that PRC2-mediated repressive chromatin modifications accumulate extremely slowly. The model generates self-perpetuating, bistable active and repressed chromatin states that persist through DNA replication, thereby ensuring high-fidelity transmission of the current chromatin state. However, sufficiently strong, persistent activation or repression of transcription promotes switching between active and repressed chromatin states. We observe that when chromatin modification dynamics are slow, transient pulses of transcriptional activation or repression are effectively filtered, such that epigenetic memory is retained. Noise filtering thus depends on slow chromatin dynamics and may represent an important function of PRC2-based regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Berry","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"berry2017","container-title":"Cell Systems","container-title-short":"Cell Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.cels.2017.02.013","ISSN":"2405-4712","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,26]]},"language":"en","page":"445-457.e8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Slow Chromatin Dynamics Allow Polycomb Target Genes to Filter Fluctuations in Transcription Factor Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471217300856","volume":"4"},

The role of these interactions in determining selective binding of GR to regulatory elements remains unclear. Recent ﬁndings indicate that a large fraction of genomic GR binding coincides with chromatin that is accessible prior to hormone treatment, suggesting that receptor binding is dictated by proteins that maintain chromatin in an open state. Combining DNaseI accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing, we identify the activator protein 1 (AP1) as a major partner for productive GR-chromatin interactions. AP1 is critical for GR-regulated transcription and recruitment to co-occupied regulatory elements, illustrating an extensive AP1-GR interaction network. Importantly, the maintenance of baseline chromatin accessibility facilitates GR recruitment and is dependent on AP1 binding.

Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36-speciﬁc lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements results in removal of H3K36 methylation, creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modiﬁcation. KDM2A utilizes a zinc ﬁnger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that preferentially recognizes nonmethylated CpG DNA, and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands.

Measuring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding at 20 min intervals over the course of ZGA reveals that the checkpoint coincides with widespread de novo recruitment of Pol II that precedes and does not require a functional checkpoint. This recruitment drives slowing or stalling of DNA replication at transcriptionally engaged loci.

These open states are stably maintained in highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of the MBT.

  {"id":"bonnet2022","abstract":"The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1, PRC2, and PR-DUB repress target genes by modifying their chromatin. In Drosophila, PRC1 compacts chromatin and monoubiquitinates histone H2A at lysine 118 (H2Aub1), whereas PR-DUB is a major H2Aub1 deubiquitinase, but how H2Aub1 levels must be balanced for Polycomb repression remains unclear. We show that in early embryos, H2Aub1 is enriched at Polycomb target genes, where it facilitates H3K27me3 deposition by PRC2 to mark genes for repression. During subsequent stages of development, H2Aub1 becomes depleted from these genes and is no longer enriched when Polycomb maintains them repressed. Accordingly, Polycomb targets remain repressed in H2Aub1-deficient animals. In PR-DUB catalytic mutants, high levels of H2Aub1 accumulate at Polycomb target genes, and Polycomb repression breaks down. These high H2Aub1 levels do not diminish Polycomb protein complex binding or H3K27 trimethylation but increase DNA accessibility. We show that H2Aub1 interferes with nucleosome stacking and chromatin fiber folding in vitro. Consistent with this, Polycomb repression defects in PR-DUB mutants are exacerbated by reducing PRC1 chromatin compaction activity, but Polycomb repression is restored if PRC1 E3 ligase activity is removed. PR-DUB therefore acts as a rheostat that removes excessive H2Aub1 that, although deposited by PRC1, antagonizes PRC1-mediated chromatin compaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Boichenko","given":"Iulia"},{"family":"Kalb","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Jeune","given":"Mathilde Le"},{"family":"Maltseva","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Pieropan","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Finkl","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Fierz","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"bonnet2022","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.350014.122","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"19-20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1046-1061","PMID":"36357125","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"PR-DUB preserves Polycomb repression by preventing excessive accumulation of H2Aub1, an antagonist of chromatin compaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/36/19-20/1046","volume":"36"},

We have determined the molecular lesions of nine Scm mutant alleles, which identify functional requirements for specific domains. The Scm alleles were tested for genetic interactions with mutations in other PcG genes. Intriguingly, three hypomorphic Scm mutations, which map within an mbt repeat, interact with PcG mutations more strongly than do Scm null alleles. The strongest interactions produce partial synthetic lethality that affects doubly heterozygous females more severely than males. We show that mbt repeat alleles produce stable SCM proteins that associate with normal sites in polytene chromosomes. We also analyzed progeny from Scm mutant germline clones to compare the effects of an mbt repeat mutation during embryonic vs. pupal development.

Using this method in cultured S2R+ cells, we efficiently tagged four endogenous proteins with the bright fluorescent protein mNeonGreen, thereby demonstrating that an existing collection of CRISPaint universal donor plasmids is compatible with insect cells. In addition, we inserted the transgenesis marker 3xP3-red fluorescent protein into seven genes in the fly germ line, producing heritable loss-of-function alleles that were isolated by simple fluorescence screening. Unlike in cultured cells, insertions/deletions always occurred at the genomic insertion site, which prevents predictably matching the insert coding frame to the target gene. Despite this effect, we were able to isolate T2A-Gal4 insertions in four genes that serve as in vivo expression reporters.

In Ewing sarcoma, we ﬁnd that the BAF complex is recruited by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein to tumor-speciﬁc enhancers and contributes to target gene activation. This process is a neomorphic property of EWS-FLI1 compared to wild-type FLI1 and depends on tyrosine residues that are necessary for phase transitions of the EWSR1 prion-like domain. Furthermore, fusion of short fragments of EWSR1 to FLI1 is sufﬁcient to recapitulate BAF complex retargeting and EWSFLI1 activities. Our studies thus demonstrate that the physical properties of prion-like domains can retarget critical chromatin regulatory complexes to establish and maintain oncogenic gene expression programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Boulay","given":"Gaylor"},{"family":"Sandoval","given":"Gabriel J."},{"family":"Riggi","given":"Nicolo"},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Sowmya"},{"family":"Buisson","given":"Rémi"},{"family":"Naigles","given":"Beverly"},{"family":"Awad","given":"Mary E."},{"family":"Rengarajan","given":"Shruthi"},{"family":"Volorio","given":"Angela"},{"family":"McBride","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Broye","given":"Liliane C."},{"family":"Zou","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Stamenkovic","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Kadoch","given":"Cigall"},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Miguel N."}],"citation-key":"boulay2017","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.036","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9]]},"language":"en","page":"163-178.e19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cancer-Specific Retargeting of BAF Complexes by a Prion-like Domain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867417308723","volume":"171"},

To search for parasegment-specific signatures that reflect PcG function, chromatin from single parasegments was isolated and profiled. The H3K27me3 profiles across the BX-C in successive parasegments showed a ‘stairstep’ pattern that revealed sharp boundaries of the BX-C regulatory domains. Acetylated H3K27 was broadly enriched across active domains, in a pattern complementary to H3K27me3.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure1. PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development2,3,4,5,6 and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency2, but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys 27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Our results indicate that dynamic repression of developmental pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyer","given":"Laurie A."},{"family":"Plath","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Zeitlinger","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Brambrink","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Medeiros","given":"Lea A."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tong Ihn"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Stuart S."},{"family":"Wernig","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Tajonar","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Mridula K."},{"family":"Bell","given":"George W."},{"family":"Otte","given":"Arie P."},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Gifford","given":"David K."},{"family":"Young","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Jaenisch","given":"Rudolf"}],"citation-key":"boyer2006","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature04733","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7091","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2006 Nature Publishing Group","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"7091","page":"349-353","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04733","volume":"441"},

How reliable are these predictions? In this review, it is argued that the relationship between the accessibility and activity of an enhancer is insufficiently described by simply considering open versus closed chromatin, or active versus inactive enhancers. Instead, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states. While the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. Molecular mechanisms that may account for these quantitative differences are discussed.

To validate spatially predicted enhancers, we use a large collection of enhancer–reporter lines and identify ~ 85% of enhancers in which chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity are coupled.

Exploiting cell type‐specific enhancers, we deconvolute cell type‐specific effects of bulk‐derived chromatin accessibility QTLs. Finally, we discover that Prospero drives neuronal differentiation through the binding of a GGG motif. In summary, we provide a comprehensive spatial characterization of gene regulation in a 2D tissue., In this study, scRNA‐seq and scATAC‐seq atlases of the Drosophila eye‐antennal disc are spatially integrated. A combination of enhancer‐reporter assays, machine learning, caQTL analysis and genetic perturbations identifies core regulatory mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bravo González‐Blas","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Xiao‐Jiang"},{"family":"Duran‐Romaña","given":"Ramon"},{"family":"Taskiran","given":"Ibrahim Ihsan"},{"family":"Koldere","given":"Duygu"},{"family":"Davie","given":"Kristofer"},{"family":"Christiaens","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Makhzami","given":"Samira"},{"family":"Hulselmans","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Waegeneer","given":"Maxime","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mauduit","given":"David"},{"family":"Poovathingal","given":"Suresh"},{"family":"Aibar","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Aerts","given":"Stein"}],"citation-key":"bravogonzalez-blas2020","container-title":"Molecular Systems Biology","container-title-short":"Mol Syst Biol","DOI":"10.15252/msb.20209438","ISSN":"1744-4292","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,19]]},"page":"e9438","PMCID":"PMC7237818","PMID":"32431014","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Identification of genomic enhancers through spatial integration of single‐cell transcriptomics and epigenomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237818/","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"bredesen2019","abstract":"Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are cis-regulatory DNA elements that maintain gene transcription states through DNA replication and mitosis. PREs have little sequence similarity, but are enriched in a number of sequence motifs. Previous methods for modelling Drosophila melanogaster PRE sequences (PREdictor and EpiPredictor) have used a set of 7 motifs and a training set of 12 PREs and 16-23 non-PREs. Advances in experimental methods for mapping chromatin binding factors and modifications has led to the publication of several genome-wide sets of Polycomb targets. In addition to the seven motifs previously used, PREs are enriched in the GTGT motif, recently associated with the sequence-specific DNA binding protein Combgap. We investigated whether models trained on genome-wide Polycomb sites generalize to independent PREs when trained with control sequences generated by naive PRE models and including the GTGT motif. We also developed a new PRE predictor: SVM-MOCCA. Training PRE predictors with genome-wide experimental data improves generalization to independent data, and SVM-MOCCA predicts the majority of PREs in three independent experimental sets. We present 2908 candidate PREs enriched in sequence and chromatin signatures. 2412 of these are also enriched in H3K4me1, a mark of Trithorax activated chromatin, suggesting that PREs/TREs have a common sequence code.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bredesen","given":"Bjørn André"},{"family":"Rehmsmeier","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"bredesen2019","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","container-title-short":"Nucleic Acids Research","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkz617","ISSN":"0305-1048","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,5]]},"page":"7781-7797","source":"Silverchair","title":"DNA sequence models of genome-wide Drosophila melanogaster Polycomb binding sites improve generalization to independent Polycomb Response Elements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz617","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"breen1986","abstract":"A relatively large number of genes have been described that are required for the normal spatial expression of the genes of the bithorax complex. Most of these regulators appear to act negatively and are required to prevent indiscriminate expression of bithorax complex (BX-C) functions. In this report we examine five negative BX-C regulators to determine whether these are maternally expressed in germ-line derived cells. The genes studied include Additional sex combs (Asx), Polycomblike (Pcl), Sex comb extra (Sce), Sex comb on midleg (Scm), and lethal(4)29 [l(4)29]. The maternal germ-line dependent expression of each of these genes is assessed by comparison of zygotes from mothers whose functional germ cells carry no wild-type alleles to zygotes from mothers whose germ cells contain one wild-type allele. Because mutant alleles of each of the genes studied are recessive lethals, mosaic females with homozygous or hemizygous mutant germ lines were produced by pole cell transplantation. The results demonstrate that all of the negative regulators tested are expressed in the maternal germ line and all play important roles in the regulation of BX-C activities during embryogenesis. The absence of maternally supplied products from all of the genes studied except l(4)29 can be largely or completely compensated for by the activity in the zygote of a paternally contributed wild-type allele. It is argued that, with the exception of l(4)29, the genes studied in this report are qualitatively similar in function to the previously described BX-C regulators Pc, esc, and sxc. The available evidence indicates that genes within this group have functions that are not restricted to the regulation of genes that control segmental identity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Breen","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Ian M."}],"citation-key":"breen1986","container-title":"Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1016/0012-1606(86)90015-1","ISSN":"0012-1606","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"442-456","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Maternal expression of genes that regulate the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012160686900151","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"brown2003","abstract":"Polycomb group proteins (PcG) repress homeotic genes in cells where these genes must remain inactive during Drosophila and vertebrate development. This repression depends on cis-acting silencer sequences, called Polycomb group response elements (PREs). Pleiohomeotic (Pho), the only known sequence-specific DNA-binding PcG protein, binds to PREs but phomutants show only mild phenotypes compared with other PcG mutants. We characterize pho-like, a gene encoding a protein with high similarity to Pho. Pho-like binds to Pho-binding sites in vitro and pho-like,pho double mutants show more severe misexpression of homeotic genes than do the single mutants. These results suggest that Pho and Pho-like act redundantly to repress homeotic genes. We examined the distribution of five PcG proteins on polytene chromosomes from pho-like, pho double mutants. Pc, Psc, Scm, E(z) and Ph remain bound to polytene chromosomes at most sites in the absence of Pho and Pho-like. At a few chromosomal locations,however, some of the PcG proteins are no longer present in the absence of Pho and Pho-like, suggesting that Pho-like and Pho may anchor PcG protein complexes to only a subset of PREs. Alternatively, Pho-like and Pho may not participate in the anchoring of PcG complexes, but may be necessary for transcriptional repression mediated through PREs. In contrast to Pho and Pho-like, removal of Trithorax-like/GAGA factor or Zeste, two other DNA-binding proteins implicated in PRE function, does not cause misexpression of homeotic genes or reporter genes in imaginal disks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"J.

  {"id":"brown2013","abstract":"Polycomb group response elements (PREs) play an essential role in gene regulation by the Polycomb group (PcG) repressor proteins in Drosophila. PREs are required for the recruitment and maintenance of repression by the PcG proteins. PREs are made up of binding sites for multiple DNA-binding proteins, but it is still unclear what combination(s) of binding sites is required for PRE activity. Here we compare the binding sites and activities of two closely linked yet separable PREs of the Drosophila engrailed (en) gene, PRE1 and PRE2. Both PRE1 and PRE2 contain binding sites for multiple PRE–DNA-binding proteins, but the number, arrangement, and spacing of the sites differs between the two PREs. These differences have functional consequences. Both PRE1 and PRE2 mediate pairing-sensitive silencing of mini-white, a functional assay for PcG repression; however, PRE1 requires two binding sites for Pleiohomeotic (Pho), whereas PRE2 requires only one Pho-binding site for this activity. Furthermore, for full pairing-sensitive silencing activity, PRE1 requires an AT-rich region not found in PRE2. These two PREs behave differently in a PRE embryonic and larval reporter construct inserted at an identical location in the genome.

Given the complex genetic network controlling early eye development, identification of regulatory sequences controlling gene expression will provide valuable insights toward understanding central events of early eye specification. We have focused on defining regulatory elements critical for Drosophila eyes absent (eya) expression. Although eya has a complex expression pattern during development, analysis of eye-specific mutations in the gene revealed a region selectively deleted in the eye-specific alleles. Here we have performed detailed analysis of the region deleted in the eye-specific eya2 allele. This analysis shows that this region can direct earlyeya gene expression in a pattern consistent with that of normal eya in eye progenitor cells. Functional studies indicate that this element will restore appropriate eya transcript expression to rescue the eye-specific allele. We have examined regulation of this element during eye specification, both in normal eye development and in ectopic eye formation. These studies demonstrate that the element was activated upon ectopic expression of the eye specification genes eyeless and dachshund, but does not respond to ectopic expression of eya or sine oculis. The differential regulation of this element by genes involved during early retinal formation reveals new aspects of the genetic hierarchy of eye development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bui","given":"Quang T."},{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"John E."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Haixi"},{"family":"Gray-Board","given":"Gladys L."},{"family":"Bonini","given":"Nancy M."}],"citation-key":"bui2000","container-title":"Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1006/dbio.2000.9688","ISSN":"0012-1606","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"355-364","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Functional Analysis of an Eye Enhancer of the Drosophila eyes absent Gene: Differential Regulation by Eye Specification Genes","title-short":"Functional Analysis of an Eye Enhancer of the Drosophila eyes absent Gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001216060099688X","volume":"221"},

We studied Hox TF DNA-binding and regulatory activity during an in vitro motor neuron differentiation system that recapitulates embryonic development. We found diversity in the genomic binding profiles of different Hox TFs, even among the posterior group paralogs that share similar DNA-binding domains. These differences in genomic binding were explained by differing abilities to bind to previously inaccessible sites. For example, the posterior group HOXC9 had a greater ability to bind occluded sites than the posterior HOXC10, producing different binding patterns and driving differential gene expression programs. From these results, we propose that the differential abilities of posterior Hox TFs to bind to previously inaccessible chromatin drive patterning diversification.\nThis article has an associated ‘The people behind the papers’ interview.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bulajić","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Divyanshi"},{"family":"Dasen","given":"Jeremy S."},{"family":"Wichterle","given":"Hynek"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Mazzoni","given":"Esteban O."}],"citation-key":"bulajic2020","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.194761","ISSN":"0950-1991, 1477-9129","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,15]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020.

To explore this possibility the responses of the endogenous metallothionein gene and an in vitro constructed chimeric gene containing the metallothiortein promoter were examined. Copper and cadmium, when added to the growth medium of Drosophila Schneider's line 2 cells, can produce a 30–100 fold induction of metallothionein mRNA levels. The level of induction depends on the amount of copper or cadmium added to the medium and these mRNA levels remain high for at least four days.

  {"id":"busby1999","abstract":"Transcription activation by Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) at each of two classes of simple CAP-dependent promoters is understood in structural and mechanistic detail. At class I CAP-dependent promoters, CAP activates transcription from a DNA site located upstream of the DNA site for RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP); at these promoters, transcription activation involves protein-protein interactions between CAP and the RNAP α subunit C-terminal domain that facilitate binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the RNAP-promoter closed complex. At class II CAP-dependent promoters, CAP activates transcription from a DNA site that overlaps the DNA site for RNAP; at these promoters, transcription activation involves both: (i) protein-protein interactions between CAP and RNAP α subunit C-terminal domain that facilitate binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the RNAP-promoter closed complex; and (ii) protein-protein interactions between CAP and RNAP α subunit N-terminal domain that facilitates isomerization of the RNAP-promoter closed complex to the RNAP-promoter open complex. Straightforward combination of the mechanisms for transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits synergistic transcription activation by multiple molecules of CAP, or by CAP and other activators. Interference with determinants of CAP or RNAP involved in transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits “anti-activation” by negative regulators. Basic features of transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters appear to be generalizable to other activators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Busby","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Ebright","given":"Richard H"}],"citation-key":"busby1999","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1006/jmbi.1999.3161","ISSN":"0022-2836","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,10,22]]},"language":"en","page":"199-213","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Transcription activation by catabolite activator protein (CAP)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699931613","volume":"293"},

Information obtained from this model has helped to better understand equivalent mechanisms in vertebrates, particularly in the context of the orientation of fluid flow mediated by multiciliated cells and cell rearrangements during convergent extension.Mutations in PCP genes have been implicated in diverse human pathologies, and the body of evidence supporting the involvement of PCP aberrations in human birth defects continues to grow rapidly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Mitchell T."},{"family":"Wallingford","given":"John B."}],"citation-key":"butler2017","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/nrm.2017.11","ISSN":"1471-0080","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Combining biophysical experiments, theory and bioinformatics, we dissect the interplay between the DNA-binding domain of Engrailed, a Drosophila TF, and the regulatory regions of its target genes. We find that Engrailed binding affinity is strongly amplified by the DNA regions flanking the recognition site, which contain long tracts of degenerate recognition-site repeats. Such DNA organization operates as an antenna that attracts TF molecules in a promiscuous exchange among myriads of intermediate affinity binding sites. The antenna ensures a local TF supply, enables gene tracking and fine control of the target site’s basal occupancy.

Most newly formed boundaries are occupied by combinations of CTCF, BEAF-32, and/or CP190. Depleting each insulator individually from chromatin revealed that TADs can still establish, although with lower insulation, with a subset of boundaries (~10%) being more dependent on specific insulators. Some weakened boundaries have aberrant gene expression due to unconstrained enhancer activity. However, the majority of misexpressed genes have no obvious direct relationship to changes in domain-boundary insulation. Deletion of an active promoter (thereby blocking transcription) at one boundary had a greater impact than deleting the insulator-bound region itself.

While cross-linking, immuno-precipitation and super-resolution microscopy argue against direct interaction of Polycomb with some lncRNAs, there is increasing evidence supporting the ability of both PRC1 and PRC2 to functionally associate with RNA. Recent data indicate that these interactions are in most cases spurious, but nonetheless crucial for a number of cellular activities. In this review, we suggest that while PRC1/2 recruitment by HOTAIR might be direct, in the case of Xist, it might occur indirectly and, at least in part, through the process of liquid–liquid phase separation.

Mammalian cells express multiple oxygen-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their oxygen affinities and hence their ability to sense oxygen. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is oxygen sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects.

Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer–promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Hongtao"},{"family":"Levo","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Barinov","given":"Lev"},{"family":"Fujioka","given":"Miki"},{"family":"Jaynes","given":"James B."},{"family":"Gregor","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"chen2018","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0175-z","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Biophysics;Gene regulation;Synthetic biology\nSubject_term_id: biophysics;gene-regulation;synthetic-biology","number":"9","page":"1296-1303","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Dynamic interplay between enhancer–promoter topology and gene activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0175-z","volume":"50"},

How Polycomb domains are reprogrammed during mammalian preimplantation development remains largely unclear. Here we show that, although H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are highly colocalized in gametes, they undergo differential reprogramming dynamics following fertilization. H3K27me3 maintains thousands of maternally biased domains until the blastocyst stage, whereas maternally biased H2AK119ub1 distribution in zygotes is largely equalized at the two-cell stage. Notably, while maternal PRC2 depletion has a limited effect on global H2AK119ub1 in early embryos, it disrupts allelic H2AK119ub1 at H3K27me3 imprinting loci including Xist. By contrast, acute H2AK119ub1 depletion in zygotes does not affect H3K27me3 imprinting maintenance, at least by the four-cell stage. Importantly, loss of H2AK119ub1, but not H3K27me3, causes premature activation of developmental genes during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and subsequent embryonic arrest. Thus, our study reveals distinct dynamics and functions of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in mouse preimplantation embryos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"Djekidel","given":"Mohamed Nadhir"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"chen2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00821-2","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Embryogenesis;Epigenetics\nSubject_term_id: embryogenesis;epigenetics","number":"4","page":"551-563","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Distinct dynamics and functions of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 in mouse preimplantation embryos","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00821-2","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"cheutin2012","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Recent genome-wide analyses showed a Polycomb (PC) distribution with binding to discrete PcG response elements (PREs). Within the cell nucleus, PcG proteins localize in structures called PC bodies that contain PcG-silenced genes, and it has been recently shown that PREs form local and long-range spatial networks. Here, we studied the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic (PH). Thanks to a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we could analyze the formation and the mobility of PC bodies during fly embryogenesis as well as compare their behavior to that of the condensed fraction of euchromatin. Immuno-FISH experiments show that PC bodies mainly correspond to 3D structural counterparts of the linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates that two types of motion influence the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H2Av-GFP. First, chromatin domains and PC bodies coordinately undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories. Second, each PC body and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion. In this motion regime, PC bodies move within volumes slightly larger than those of condensed chromatin domains. Moreover, both types of domains move within volumes much smaller than chromosome territories, strongly restricting their possibility of interaction with other nuclear structures. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis strongly decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheutin","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Giacomo"}],"citation-key":"cheutin2012","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1002465","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e1002465","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Progressive Polycomb Assembly on H3K27me3 Compartments Generates Polycomb Bodies with Developmentally Regulated Motion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002465","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"cheutin2019","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins silence master regulatory genes required to properly confer cell identity during the development of both Drosophila and mammals. They may act through chromatin compaction and higher-order folding of chromatin inside the cell nucleus. During the last decade, analysis on interphase chromosome architecture discovered self-interacting regions named topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs result from the 3D chromatin folding of a succession of transcribed and repressed epigenomic domains and from loop extrusion mediated by cohesin/CTCF in mammals. Polycomb silenced chromatin constitutes one type of repressed epigenomic domains which form compacted nano-compartments inside cell nuclei. Recruitment of canonical PcG proteins on chromatin relies on initial binding to discrete elements and further spreading into large chromatin domains covered with H3K27me3. Some of these discrete elements have a bivalent nature both in mammals and Drosophila and are dynamically regulated during development. Loops can occur between them, suggesting that their interaction plays both functional and structural roles. Formation of large chromatin domains covered by H3K27me3 seems crucial for PcG silencing and PcG proteins might exert their function through compaction of these domains in both mammals and flies, rather than by directly controlling the nucleosomal accessibility of discrete regulatory elements. In addition, PcG chromatin domains interact over long genomic distances, shaping a higher-order chromatin network. Therefore, PcG silencing might rely on multiscale chromatin folding to maintain cell identity during differentiation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheutin","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Giacomo"}],"citation-key":"cheutin2019","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1080/10409238.2019.1679082","ISSN":"1040-9238","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"page":"399-417","PMID":"31698957","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The multiscale effects of polycomb mechanisms on 3D chromatin folding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10409238.2019.1679082","volume":"54"},

ESC is a key component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates H3K27me3 modification. Enhanced Pol II occupancy is observed for thousands of genes in esc mutant embryos, including genes not directly regulated by PRC2. Thus, it would appear that silent genes lacking promoter-associated paused Pol II in wild-type embryos are converted into “poised” genes with paused Pol II in esc mutants.

Another set of promoters inside LADs is able to \"escape\" repression, although their transcription elongation is attenuated. By inserting reporters into thousands of genomic locations, we demonstrate that these escaper promoters are intrinsically less sensitive to LAD repression.

  {"id":"christleemans2019","abstract":"Summary  It is largely unclear whether genes that are naturally embedded in lamina-associated domains (LADs) are inactive due to their chromatin environment or whether LADs are merely secondary to the lack of transcription. We show that hundreds of human promoters become active when moved from their native LAD position to a neutral context in the same cells, indicating that LADs form a repressive environment. Another set of promoters inside LADs is able to \"escape\" repression, although their transcription elongation is attenuated. By inserting reporters into thousands of genomic locations, we demonstrate that escaper promoters are intrinsically less sensitive to LAD repression. This is not simply explained by promoter strength but by the interplay between promoter sequence and local chromatin features that vary strongly across LADs. Enhancers also differ in their sensitivity to LAD chromatin.

We propose the ‘hourglass’ model of remodeller function, in which each remodeller subfamily utilizes diverse specialized proteins and protein domains to assist in nucleosome targeting or to differentially detect nucleosome epitopes. These modules converge to regulate a common DNA translocation mechanism, to inform the conserved ATPase ‘motor’ on whether and how to apply DNA translocation, which together achieve the various outcomes of chromatin remodelling: nucleosome assembly, chromatin access and nucleosome editing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Clapier","given":"Cedric R."},{"family":"Iwasa","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Cairns","given":"Bradley R."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Craig L."}],"citation-key":"clapier2017","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/nrm.2017.26","ISSN":"1471-0072, 1471-0080","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"language":"en","page":"407-422","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mechanisms of action and regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.26","volume":"18"},

Major efforts have thus been dedicated to understanding mechanisms controlling Hox expression.

Factors contributing to Hox silencing include the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), which control gene expression through epigenetic modifications. This review focuses on PRC-dependent regulation of the Hox genes and is aimed at integrating the growing complexity of PRC functional properties in the context of Hox regulation.

  {"id":"coleman2017","abstract":"DNA sequence and inherited gene silencing\n            \n              Cell fate decisions require a gene's transcriptional status, whether on or off, to be stably and heritably maintained over multiple cell generations. For silenced genes, heterochromatin domains are associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications, and these histone marks are maintained during DNA replication and chromosome duplication (see the Perspective by De and Kassis). Laprell\n              et al.\n              show that parental methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) nucleosomes in\n              Drosophila\n              are inherited in daughter cells after replication and can repress transcription, but that they are not sufficient to propagate the mark. Trimethylation of newly incorporated nucleosomes requires recruitment of the methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to neighboring cis-regulatory DNA elements. Coleman and Struhl demonstrate that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting epigenetic memory at a\n              Drosophila\n              HOX gene through anchoring of PRC2 at the Polycomb response element binding site.

A long-standing question is whether such epigenetic states can be maintained by the inheritance of cis-acting chromatin modifications. To answer this question, it is necessary to identify those modifications that play a causal role in epigenetic memory and investigate how they are maintained and propagated through multiple rounds of replication.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              \n                Many animals are composed of diverse body segments governed by evolutionarily conserved HOX gene complexes. Early in embryogenesis, cells in each segment heritably activate some HOX genes while silencing others. This provides a paradigm of epigenetic memory in which transient cues establish permanent ON and OFF states of gene expression. In the OFF state, HOX gene chromatin is marked with trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) that is catalyzed by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Here, we investigated whether H3K27me3 nucleosomes are the carriers of epigenetic memory of the OFF state. To this end, we generated a transgenic\n                lacZ\n                reporter of the\n                Drosophila\n                HOX gene\n                Ultrabithorax\n                (\n                Ubx\n                ), which recapitulates\n                Ubx\n                regulation throughout development. Deposition of H3K27me3 at this reporter depends on the presence of a Polycomb response element (PRE), the cis-acting DNA to which PRC2 is targeted. We monitored both the OFF state and H3K27me3 after inducing excision of the PRE at different time points during development. Using this strategy, in combination with manipulation of PRC2 activity and H3K27 substrate availability, we assessed the capacity of PRC2 that is not recruited to the PRE to propagate H3K27me3 and investigated whether there is a causal relationship between H3K27me3 inheritance and maintenance of the OFF state.\n              \n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Focusing on the developing wing imaginal disc where the transgene is normally OFF, we find that PRE excision results in a release from silencing that depends on the cell-division–coupled dilution of H3K27me3 and occurs after a stereotyped number of cell divisions. Further, we show that the rate of dilution depends on the residual capacity of PRC2 that is not recruited by the PRE to propagate the mark. Reducing this capacity increases the rate of dilution and leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of times a cell can divide while maintaining the OFF state. These findings establish a causal relationship between inheritance of the H3K27me3 mark and memory of the OFF state.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              \n                Our results demonstrate (i) that H3K27me3, once established at a repressed\n                Drosophila\n                HOX gene, remains heritably associated with that gene; (ii) that local inheritance of the mark transmits the memory of the OFF state from one cell generation to the next; and (iii) that long-term memory depends on efficient copying of the mark after each replication cycle, a process that requires recruitment of PRC2 by the PRE. Taken together, these findings establish H3K27me3 as a determinant of epigenetic memory and identify efficient propagation of the mark by PRE-associated PRC2 as a requirement for perpetuating the memory.\n              \n              \n                \n                  Epigenetic silencing of a HOX gene by inheritance of H3K27 trimethylation.\n                  Inheritance of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin depends on the transmission of parental H3K27me3 nucleosomes to daughter DNAs and their capacity to template the H3K27 trimethylation of newly incorporated, naïve nucleosomes by PRE-associated PRC2. After PRE excision, residual “free” PRC2 can copy the mark, albeit inefficiently, resulting in replication-coupled serial dilution of H3K27me3 and release from silencing. The number of divisions required depends on the rate of dilution, establishing a causal relationship between inheritance of the mark and memory of the OFF state.\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              Many eukaryotic cells can respond to transient environmental or developmental stimuli with heritable changes in gene expression that are associated with nucleosome modifications. However, it remains uncertain whether modified nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting such epigenetic memories, as opposed to controlling or merely reflecting transcriptional states inherited by other means. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes, once established at a repressed\n              Drosophila\n              HOX gene, remain heritably associated with that gene and can carry the memory of the silenced state through multiple rounds of replication, even when the capacity to copy the H3K27me3 mark to newly incorporated nucleosomes is diminished or abolished.

  {"id":"coleman2022","abstract":"Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are cis-acting DNA sequences that confer heritable states of Drosophila HOX gene expression by anchoring Polycomb and Trithorax Group (PcG and TrxG) chromatin modifiers. PREs are also associated with hundreds of other Drosophila genes, most of which are regulated dynamically in response to developmental and physiological context, rather than heritably like HOX genes. Here, we assess the role(s) PREs play at these other loci by analyzing how genomic inserts of a transgenic form of the HOX gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) can both control and respond to neighboring genes depending on the presence of a single, excisable PRE. Our results support the view that PREs and their associated PcG and TrxG modifiers act primarily to confer quantitative, rather than qualitative, influences on gene expression with the response of any given gene depending on how it integrates this information with other regulatory elements in the local genomic milieu. They also show that PREs can act on neighboring genes selectively and at remarkably long range, but that any given gene can be susceptible or impervious to PRE/PcG/TrxG input depending on context. Finally, we find that transcription and PRE/PcG-dependent silencing are not mutually exclusive: a Ubx transgene inside the intron of a continuously transcribed \"host\" gene is nevertheless silenced by its resident PRE. We posit that the widely accepted roles of PcG and TrxG complexes in maintaining heritable states of gene expression apply only to a limited coterie of target genes such as HOX genes that are evolutionarily selected to exclude regulatory elements that can over-ride this control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Coleman","given":"Rory T."},{"family":"Struhl","given":"Gary"}],"citation-key":"coleman2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.05.11.491498","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,11]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"collombet2020","abstract":"Paternal and maternal epigenomes undergo marked changes after fertilization1. Recent epigenomic studies have revealed the unusual chromatin landscapes that are present in oocytes, sperm and early preimplantation embryos, including atypical patterns of histone modifications2–4 and differences in chromosome organization and accessibility, both in gametes5–8 and after fertilization5,8–10. However, these studies have led to very different conclusions: the global absence of local topological-associated domains (TADs) in gametes and their appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the pre-existence of TADs and loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures might relate to allele-specific gene regulation remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental genome (including the X chromosome), using an optimized single-cell high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (HiC) protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate chromosome organization with allelic expression states and chromatin marks, and reveal that higher-order chromatin structure after fertilization coincides with an allele-specific enrichment of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. These early parental-specific domains correlate with gene repression and participate in parentally biased gene expression—including in recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find TADs that arise in a non-parental-specific manner during a second wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the relationship between TADs and gene expression by investigating structural changes to the paternal X chromosome before and during X chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We find that TADs are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal X chromosome but linger in regions that escape X chromosome inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression during early development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Collombet","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Ranisavljevic","given":"Noémie"},{"family":"Nagano","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Varnai","given":"Csilla"},{"family":"Shisode","given":"Tarak"},{"family":"Leung","given":"Wing"},{"family":"Piolot","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Galupa","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Borensztein","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Servant","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Ancelin","given":"Katia"},{"family":"Heard","given":"Edith"}],"citation-key":"collombet2020","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2125-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7801","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Embryogenesis;Epigenetic memory\nSubject_term_id: embryogenesis;epigenetic-memory","number":"7801","page":"142-146","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Parental-to-embryo switch of chromosome organization in early embryogenesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2125-z","volume":"580"},
  {"id":"comet2011","abstract":"Regulation of gene expression involves long-distance communication between regulatory elements and target promoters, but how this is achieved remains unknown. Insulator elements have been proposed to modulate the communication between regulatory elements and promoters due to their ability to insulate genes from regulatory elements or to take part in long-distance interactions. Using a high-resolution chromatin conformation capture (H3C) method, we show that the Drosophila gypsy insulator behaves as a conformational chromatin border that is able to prohibit contacts between a Polycomb response element (PRE) and a distal promoter. On the other hand, two spaced gypsy elements form a chromatin loop that is able to bring an upstream PRE in contact with a downstream gene to mediate its repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiles of the Polycomb protein and its associated H3K27me3 histone mark reflect this insulator-dependent chromatin conformation, suggesting that Polycomb action at a distance can be organized by local chromatin topology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Comet","given":"Itys"},{"family":"Schuettengruber","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Sexton","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Giacomo"}],"citation-key":"comet2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1002059108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,8]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

The gene egl-1 encodes a BH3-containing cell death activator that is required for programmed cell death in C. elegans. Gain-of-function (gf) mutations in egl-1 cause the inappropriate programmed cell death of the HSNs in hermaphrodites. These mutations lie 5.6 kb downstream of the egl-1 transcription unit and disrupt the binding of the TRA-1A zinc finger protein, the terminal global regulator of somatic sexual fate. This disruption results in the activation of the egl-1 gene in the HSNs not only in males but also in hermaphrodites. Our findings suggest that in hermaphrodites TRA-1A represses egl-1 transcription in the HSNs to prevent these neurons from undergoing programmed cell death.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Conradt","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Horvitz","given":"H.Robert"}],"citation-key":"conradt1999","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10/fdscdr","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,8]]},"language":"en","page":"317-327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The TRA-1A Sex Determination Protein of C. elegans Regulates Sexually Dimorphic Cell Deaths by Repressing the egl-1 Cell Death Activator Gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867400819613","volume":"98"},

It is the catalytic subunit of the PR-DUB complex, which removes PRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1, essential for maintaining transcriptional repression. However, the precise relationship between BAP1 and Polycombs remains elusive. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that BAP1 restricts H2AK119ub1 deposition to Polycomb target sites. This increases the stability of Polycomb with their targets and prevents diffuse accumulation of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3. Loss of BAP1 results in a broad increase in H2AK119ub1 levels that is primarily dependent on PCGF3/5-PRC1 complexes. This titrates PRC2 away from its targets and stimulates H3K27me3 accumulation across the genome, leading to a general chromatin compaction. This provides evidence for a unifying model that resolves the apparent contradiction between BAP1 catalytic activity and its role in vivo, uncovering molecular vulnerabilities that could be useful for BAP1-related pathologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Conway","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Fernandez-Perez","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ponzo","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Karin Johanna"},{"family":"Zanotti","given":"Marika"},{"family":"Manganaro","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Rodighiero","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Tamburri","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Pasini","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"conway2021","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2021.06.020","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"3526-3541.e8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"BAP1 enhances Polycomb repression by counteracting widespread H2AK119ub1 deposition and chromatin condensation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276521005001","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"cortazar2019","abstract":"Control of transcription speed, which inﬂuences many co-transcriptional processes, is poorly understood. We report that PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation rate. The PNUTS W401A mutation, which disrupts PP1 binding, causes genome-wide acceleration of transcription associated with hyper-phosphorylation of the Spt5 elongation factor. Immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, Pol II decelerates from >2 kb/min to <1 kb/min, which correlates with Spt5 dephosphorylation. Pol II deceleration and Spt5 dephosphorylation require poly(A) site recognition and the PNUTS-PP1 complex, which is in turn necessary for transcription termination. These results lead to a model for termination, the ‘‘sitting duck torpedo’’ mechanism, where poly(A) site-dependent deceleration caused by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 dephosphorylation is required to convert Pol II into a viable target for the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease. Spt5 and its bacterial homolog NusG therefore have related functions controlling kinetic competition between RNA polymerases and the termination factors that pursue them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cortazar","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Sheridan","given":"Ryan M."},{"family":"Erickson","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Fong","given":"Nova"},{"family":"Glover-Cutter","given":"Kira"},{"family":"Brannan","given":"Kristopher"},{"family":"Bentley","given":"David L."}],"citation-key":"cortazar2019","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2019.09.031","ISSN":"10972765","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"language":"en","page":"896-908.e4","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Control of RNA Pol II Speed by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 Dephosphorylation Facilitates Termination by a “Sitting Duck Torpedo” Mechanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276519307579","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"crain2022","abstract":"Mono-methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) is catalyzed by Set8/KMT5A and regulates numerous aspects of genome organization and function. Loss-of-function mutations in Drosophila melanogaster Set8 or mammalian KMT5A prevent H4K20me1 and disrupt development. Set8/KMT5A also has non-histone substrates, making it difficult to determine which developmental functions of Set8/KMT5A are attributable to H4K20me1 and which to other substrates or to non-catalytic roles. Here, we show that human KMT5A can functionally substitute for Set8 during Drosophila development and that the catalytic SET domains of the two enzymes are fully interchangeable. We also uncovered a role in eye development for the N-terminal domain of Set8 that cannot be complemented by human KMT5A. Whereas Set820/20 null mutants are inviable, we found that an R634G mutation in Set8 predicted from in vitro experiments to ablate catalytic activity resulted in viable adults. Additionally, Set8(R634G) mutants retain significant, albeit reduced, H4K20me1, indicating that the R634G mutation does not eliminate catalytic activity in vivo and is functionally hypomorphic rather than null. Flies engineered to express only unmodifiable H4 histones (H4K20A) can also complete development, but are phenotypically distinct from H4K20R, Set820/20 null, and Set8R634G mutants. Taken together, our results demonstrate functional conservation of KMT5A and Set8 enzymes, as well as distinct roles for Set8 and H4K20me1 in Drosophila development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Crain","given":"Aaron T"},{"family":"Klusza","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Robin L"},{"family":"Santa Rosa","given":"Priscila"},{"family":"Temple","given":"Brenda R S"},{"family":"Strahl","given":"Brian D"},{"family":"McKay","given":"Daniel J"},{"family":"Matera","given":"A Gregory"},{"family":"Duronio","given":"Robert J"}],"citation-key":"crain2022","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/genetics/iyac054","ISSN":"1943-2631","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,11]]},"page":"iyac054","source":"Silverchair","title":"Distinct developmental phenotypes result from mutation of Set8/KMT5A and histone H4 lysine 20 in Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac054"},

Nucleosomes protect the genome from DNA damaging agents and provide a lattice onto which a myriad of epigenetic signals are deposited.

  {"id":"das2007","abstract":"A critical unresolved issue about the genotoxic stress response is how the resulting activation of the p53 tumor suppressor can lead either to cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair or to apoptosis. We show here that hematopoietic zinc finger (Hzf), a zinc-ﬁnger-containing p53 target gene, modulates p53 transactivation functions in an autoregulatory feedback loop. Hzf is induced by p53 and binds to its DNA-binding domain, resulting in preferential transactivation of proarrest p53 target genes over its proapoptotic target genes. Thus, p53 activation results in cell-cycle arrest in Hzf wild-type MEFs, while in HzfÀ/À MEFs, apoptosis is induced. Exposure of Hzf null mice to ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced apoptosis in several organs, as compared to in wild-type mice. These ﬁndings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 transactivation function and suggest that Hzf functions as a key player in regulating cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Sanjeev"},{"family":"Raj","given":"Lakshmi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Kimura","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Aaronson","given":"Stuart A."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sam W."}],"citation-key":"das2007","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.013","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8]]},"language":"en","page":"624-637","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hzf Determines Cell Survival upon Genotoxic Stress by Modulating p53 Transactivation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867407007799","volume":"130"},

In Drosophila, the PcG group protein complex PRC2 is recruited to discrete DNA elements called Polycomb response elements. PRC2 .....Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are an important group of transcriptional repressors that act by modifying chromatin. PcG target genes are covered by the repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a multiprotein complex that is responsible for generating H3K27me3. In Drosophila, PRC2 is recruited by Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) and then trimethylates flanking nucleosomes, spreading the H3K27me3 mark over large regions of the genome, the “Polycomb domains.” What defines the boundary of a Polycomb domain? There is experimental evidence that insulators, PolII, and active transcription can all form the boundaries of Polycomb domains. Here we divide the boundaries of larval Polycomb domains into six different categories. In one category, genes are transcribed toward the Polycomb domain, where active transcription is thought to stop the spreading of H3K27me3. In agreement with this, we show that introducing a transcriptional terminator into such a transcription unit causes an extension of the Polycomb domain. Additional data suggest that active transcription of a boundary gene may restrict the range of enhancer activity of a Polycomb-regulated gene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"De","given":"Sandip"},{"family":"Gehred","given":"Natalie D"},{"family":"Fujioka","given":"Miki"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Fountane W"},{"family":"Jaynes","given":"James B"},{"family":"Kassis","given":"Judith A"}],"citation-key":"de2020","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.120.303642","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"page":"689-700","source":"Silverchair","title":"Defining the Boundaries of Polycomb Domains in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303642","volume":"216"},

GSCs have a non-canonical distribution of PRC2 activity and lack silenced chromatin like embryonic progenitors. As GSC daughters differentiate into nurse cells and oocytes, nurse cells, like embryonic somatic cells, silence genes in traditional Polycomb domains and in generally inactive chromatin. Developmentally controlled expression of two Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-interacting proteins, Pcl and Scm, initiate silencing during differentiation. In GSCs, abundant Pcl inhibits PRC2-dependent silencing globally, while in nurse cells Pcl declines and newly induced Scm concentrates PRC2 activity on traditional Polycomb domains.

In Drosophila, DNA fragments called Polycomb-group response elements (PREs) have been identified that mediate the action of Polycomb-group proteins. Previous studies have shown that a 2 kb fragment located from -2.4 kb to -395 bp upstream of the Drosophila engrailed promoter contains a multipartite PRE that can mediate mini-white silencing and act as a PRE in an Ubx-reporter construct. Here, we study the role of this 2 kb fragment in the regulation of the engrailed gene itself. Our results show that within this 2 kb fragment, there are two subfragments that can act as PREs in embryos. In addition to their role in gene silencing, these two adjacent PRE fragments can facilitate the activation of the engrailed promoter by distant enhancers. The repressive action of the engrailed PRE can also act over a distance. A 181 bp subfragment can act as a PRE and also mediate positive effects in an enhancer-detector construct. Finally, a deletion of 530 bp of the 2 kb PRE fragment within the endogenous engrailed gene causes a loss-of-function phenotype, showing the importance of the positive regulatory effects of this PRE-containing fragment. Our data are consistent with the model that engrailed PREs bring chromatin together, allowing both positive and negative regulatory interactions between distantly located DNA fragments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"DeVido","given":"Sarah K."},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Brown","given":"J.

Both classes exhibit a broad response maximum near 150 Hz, corresponding to the typical wingbeat frequency of the blowfly, and display rectification, limiting the spike response to a narrow portion of a stimulus cycle. The similarity in the encoding properties between the two groups is largely a consequence of the high wingbeat frequency of flies, which precludes any individual neurone from acting as a magnitude detector. Instead, during flight the campaniform neurones might act as ‘one-shot’ detectors, firing a single action potential at a precise phase of each wing stroke cycle.

Although tremendous progress has been made toward defining the biochemical activities of Polycomb and trithorax group proteins, much remains to be learned about how they interact with each other and the general transcription machinery to maintain on or off states of gene expression. The trithorax group protein Kismet (KIS) is related to the SWI/SNF and CHD families of chromatin remodeling factors. KIS promotes transcription elongation, facilitates the binding of the trithorax group histone methyltransferases ASH1 and TRX to active genes, and counteracts repressive methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) by Polycomb group proteins. Here, we sought to clarify the mechanism of action of KIS and how it interacts with ASH1 to antagonize H3K27 methylation in Drosophila. We present evidence that KIS promotes transcription elongation and counteracts Polycomb group repression via distinct mechanisms. A chemical inhibitor of transcription elongation, DRB, had no effect on ASH1 recruitment or H3K27 methylation. Conversely, loss of ASH1 function had no effect on transcription elongation. Mutations in kis cause a global reduction in the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36) - modifications that antagonize H3K27 methylation in vitro. Furthermore, loss of ASH1 significantly decreases H3K36 dimethylation, providing further evidence that ASH1 is an H3K36 dimethylase in vivo.

  {"id":"duan2021","abstract":"During the essential and conserved process of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), chromatin accessibility must increase to promote transcription. Drosophila is a well-established model for defining mechanisms that drive ZGA. Zelda (ZLD) is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that promotes ZGA in the Drosophila embryo. However, many genomic loci that contain GA-rich motifs become accessible during ZGA independent of ZLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that other early TFs that function with ZLD have not yet been identified, especially those that are capable of binding to GA-rich motifs such as chromatin-linked adaptor for male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins (CLAMP). Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila embryonic development requires maternal CLAMP to (1) activate zygotic transcription; (2) increase chromatin accessibility at promoters of specific genes that often encode other essential TFs; and (3) enhance chromatin accessibility and facilitate ZLD occupancy at a subset of key embryonic promoters. Thus, CLAMP functions as a pioneer factor that plays a targeted yet essential role in ZGA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Duan","given":"Jingyue"},{"family":"Rieder","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Colonnetta","given":"Megan M"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Mckenney","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Watters","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Girish"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"William"},{"family":"Fawzi","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Larschan","given":"Erica"}],"citation-key":"duan2021","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.69937","editor":[{"family":"Yamashita","given":"Yukiko M"},{"family":"Struhl","given":"Kevin"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"page":"e69937","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"CLAMP and Zelda function together to promote Drosophila zygotic genome activation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69937","volume":"10"},

A conserved Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph) is important for chromatin compaction and large-scale chromatin organization. Like many SAMs, Ph SAM forms helical head to tail polymers, and SAM-SAM interactions between chromatin-bound Ph/PRC1 are believed to compact chromatin and mediate long-range interactions.  To understand mechanistically how this occurs, we analyzed the effects of Ph SAM on chromatin in vitro. We find that incubation of chromatin or DNA with a truncated Ph protein containing the SAM results in formation of concentrated, phase-separated condensates. Condensate formation depends on Ph SAM, and is enhanced by but not strictly dependent on, its polymerization activity. Ph SAM-dependent condensates can recruit PRC1 from extracts and enhance PRC1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards histone H2A. Overexpression of Ph with an intact SAM increases ubiquitylated H2A in cells. Thus, phase separation is an activity of the SAM, which, in the context of Ph, can mediate large-scale compaction of chromatin into biochemical compartments that facilitate histone modification.","author":[{"literal":"Elias Seif"},{"literal":"Elias Seif"},{"literal":"Jin Joo Kang"},{"literal":"Charles Sasseville"},{"literal":"Olga Senkovitch"},{"literal":"Alexander Kaltashov"},{"literal":"Elodie Boulier"},{"literal":"Ibani Kapur"},{"literal":"Chongwoo A.

  {"id":"england2016","abstract":"The biomedical field has greatly benefited from the discovery of bioluminescent proteins. Currently, scientists employ bioluminescent systems for numerous biomedical applications, ranging from highly sensitive cellular assays to bioluminescence-based molecular imaging. Traditionally, these systems are based on Firefly and Renilla luciferases; however, the applicability of these enzymes is limited by their size, stability, and luminescence efficiency. NanoLuc (NLuc), a novel bioluminescence platform, offers several advantages over established systems, including enhanced stability, smaller size, and >150-fold increase in luminescence. In addition, the substrate for NLuc displays enhanced stability and lower background activity, opening up new possibilities in the field of bioluminescence imaging. The NLuc system is incredibly versatile and may be utilized for a wide array of applications. The increased sensitivity, high stability, and small size of the NLuc system have the potential to drastically change the field of reporter assays in the future. However, as with all such technology, NLuc has limitations (including a non-ideal emission for in vivo applications and its unique substrate) which may cause it to find restricted use in certain areas of molecular biology. As this unique technology continues to broaden, NLuc may have a significant impact in both preclinical and clinical fields, with potential roles in disease detection, molecular imaging, and therapeutic monitoring.

Using an established in vivo assay for PRE activity, we demonstrated that a subset of characterized developmental enhancers can function as PREs, silencing transcription in a Polycomb-dependent manner. Conversely, some classic Drosophila PREs can function as developmental enhancers in vivo, activating spatio–temporal expression. This study therefore uncovers elements with dual function: activating transcription in some cells (enhancers) while stably maintaining transcriptional silencing in others (PREs).

  {"id":"ericconway2015","abstract":"The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a multiprotein chromatin modifying complex that is essential for vertebrate development and differentiation. It is composed of a trimeric core of SUZ12, EED and EZH1/2 and is responsible for catalysing both di-methylation and tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3). Both H3K27 methylations contribute to the role of PRC2 in maintaining cellular identity. In all cell types, the H3K27me3 modification is associated with repression of genes encoding regulators of alternative lineages. The less well-characterised H3K27me2 modification is ubiquitous throughout the genome and is thought to act like a protective blanket to maintain the repression of non-H3K27me3 associated genes and cell-type-specific enhancers of alternative lineages. Recent cancer genome sequencing studies highlighted that several genes encoding PRC2 components as well as Histone H3 are mutated in multiple cancer types. Intriguingly, these cancers have changes in the global levels of the H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 modifications as well as genome-wide redistributions.

They exist as part of two main multisubunit complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC1 complexes are defined by a heterodimeric RING-PCGF core capable of monoubiquitinating H2A. Depending on the cofactors that associate with the RING-PCGF core, PRC1 complexes can be further divided into canonical or noncanonical PRC1 (cPRC1 and ncPRC1). The cPRC1 complex is targeted to chromatin through the ability of its CBX subunit to read PRC2-mediated H3K27me3, and it promotes chromatin condensation via heterooligomerisation of its PHC subunits. The various different ncPRC1 complexes are targeted to chromatin independently of H3K27me3 by specific subunits. Recent studies suggest that the majority of PRC1-dependent H2Aub catalytic activity is mediated by the ncPRC1 complexes and that this may partially contribute to the recruitment or activity PRC2. Here we will discuss the data both supporting and conflicting with this hypothesis and examine the emerging evidence for diverse roles of different ncPRC1 complexes in transcriptional regulation, and whether some can contribute to gene activation. Finally, we will also discuss the essential roles of subunits of the cPRC1 and ncPRC1 complexes in the biology of multicellular organisms.","author":[{"literal":"Eric Conway"},{"literal":"Adrian P.

  {"id":"espinola2021","abstract":"Acquisition of cell fate is thought to rely on the specific interaction of remote cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), for example, enhancers and target promoters. However, the precise interplay between chromatin structure and gene expression is still unclear, particularly within multicellular developing organisms. In the present study, we employ Hi-M, a single-cell spatial genomics approach, to detect CRM–promoter looping interactions within topologically associating domains (TADs) during early Drosophila development. By comparing cis-regulatory loops in alternate cell types, we show that physical proximity does not necessarily instruct transcriptional states. Moreover, multi-way analyses reveal that multiple CRMs spatially coalesce to form hubs. Loops and CRM hubs are established early during development, before the emergence of TADs. Moreover, CRM hubs are formed, in part, via the action of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda and precede transcriptional activation. Our approach provides insight into the role of CRM–promoter interactions in defining transcriptional states, as well as distinct cell types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Espinola","given":"Sergio Martin"},{"family":"Götz","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Bellec","given":"Maelle"},{"family":"Messina","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Fiche","given":"Jean-Bernard"},{"family":"Houbron","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Dejean","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Reim","given":"Ingolf"},{"family":"Cardozo Gizzi","given":"Andrés M."},{"family":"Lagha","given":"Mounia"},{"family":"Nollmann","given":"Marcelo"}],"citation-key":"espinola2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00816-z","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Embryogenesis;Epigenomics;Gene regulation;Microscopy\nSubject_term_id: embryogenesis;epigenomics;gene-regulation;microscopy","number":"4","page":"477-486","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Cis-regulatory chromatin loops arise before TADs and gene activation, and are independent of cell fate during early Drosophila development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00816-z","volume":"53"},

We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1–3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms.","author":[{"literal":"Evan Healy"},{"literal":"Marlena Mucha"},{"literal":"Eleanor Glancy"},{"literal":"Darren J.

This step can be particularly laborious for events that do not cause a visible phenotype, or those which occur at relatively low frequency. A promising strategy to enrich for desired CRISPR events is to co-select for an independent CRISPR event that produces an easily detectable phenotype. Here, we describe a simple negative co-selection strategy involving CRISPR-editing of a dominant female sterile allele, ovoD1. In this system (“ovoD co-selection”), the only functional germ cells in injected females are those that have been edited at the ovoD1 locus, and thus all offspring of these flies have undergone editing of at least one locus. We demonstrate that ovoD co-selection can be used to enrich for knock-out mutagenesis via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and for knock-in alleles via homology-directed repair (HDR). Altogether, our results demonstrate that ovoD co-selection reduces the amount of screening necessary to isolate desired CRISPR events in Drosophila.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ewen-Campen","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Perrimon","given":"Norbert"}],"citation-key":"ewen-campen2018","container-title":"G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics","container-title-short":"G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/g3.118.200498","ISSN":"2160-1836","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"page":"2749-2756","source":"Silverchair","title":"ovoD Co-selection: A Method for Enriching CRISPR/Cas9-Edited Alleles in Drosophila","title-short":"ovoD Co-selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200498","volume":"8"},

PcG proteins repress numerous genes and exert their action through chromatin binding, deposition of specific histone marks, chromatin compaction, and three-dimensional (3D) organization of their target genes. Recent advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies together with microscopy studies have considerably improved our knowledge of their role in the 3D folding of the genome. In this chapter, we will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which PcG factors exert their action in the kilobase-to-megabase scale of the chromatin fiber, and how this specific nuclear organization can influence gene regulation. We will also discuss the role of noncoding RNAs in shaping PcG-dependent chromosomal organization, and how understanding the mode of Polycomb action in 3D genomics has become increasingly important for research on cancer and other diseases.","author":[{"literal":"F.

General hypotheses for tissue separation based on differential adhesion or tension have been proposed in the past, but with little experimental support.

Here, I will discuss the various models of boundary formation and summarize recent studies that have shifted our understanding of the process from the simple juxtaposition of global tissue properties to the characterization of local cellular reactions. Current evidence favors a model whereby separation is controlled by cell surface cues, which, upon cell-cell contact, generate acute changes in cytoskeletal and adhesive properties to inhibit cell mixing, and whereby the integration of multiple local cues may dictate both the global morphogenetic properties of a tissue and its separation from adjacent cell populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fagotto","given":"François"}],"citation-key":"fagotto2014","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.090332","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"page":"3303-3318","source":"Silverchair","title":"The cellular basis of tissue separation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.090332","volume":"141"},

In the case of Notch, the intracellular domain (NICD) transduces the signal directly to the nucleus. How enhancers decipher NICD in the real time of developmental decisions is not known. Using the MS2-MCP system to visualize nascent transcripts in single cells in Drosophila embryos, we reveal how two target enhancers read Notch activity to produce synchronized and sustained profiles of transcription. By manipulating the levels of NICD and altering specific motifs within the enhancers, we uncover two key principles. First, increased NICD levels alter transcription by increasing duration rather than frequency of transcriptional bursts. Second, priming of enhancers by tissue-specific transcription factors is required for NICD to confer synchronized and sustained activity; in their absence, transcription is stochastic and bursty. The dynamic response of an individual enhancer to NICD thus differs depending on the cellular context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Falo-Sanjuan","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Lammers","given":"Nicholas C."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Hernan G."},{"family":"Bray","given":"Sarah J."}],"citation-key":"falo-sanjuan2019","container-title":"Developmental Cell","container-title-short":"Developmental Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.devcel.2019.07.002","ISSN":"1534-5807","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,19]]},"language":"en","page":"411-425.e8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Enhancer Priming Enables Fast and Sustained Transcriptional Responses to Notch Signaling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580719305726","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"fangyandai2017","abstract":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is classically linked to metabolic homeostasis via the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR), which is instructed by multiple transcriptional regulatory cascades. BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor with de-ubiquitinating enzyme activity and has been implicated in chromatin regulation of gene expression. Here we show that BAP1 inhibits cell death induced by unresolved metabolic stress. This prosurvival role of BAP1 depends on its de-ubiquitinating activity and correlates with its ability to dampen the metabolic stress-induced UPR transcriptional network. BAP1 inhibits glucose deprivation-induced reactive oxygen species and ATP depletion, two cellular events contributing to the ER stress-induced cell death. In line with this,  Bap1  KO mice are more sensitive to tunicamycin-induced renal damage. Mechanically, we show that BAP1 represses metabolic stress-induced UPR and cell death through activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and reveal that BAP1 binds to  ATF3  and  CHOP  promoters and inhibits their transcription. Taken together, our results establish a previously unappreciated role of BAP1 in modulating the cellular adaptability to metabolic stress and uncover a pivotal function of BAP1 in the regulation of the ER stress gene-regulatory network.

  {"id":"farrelly2019","abstract":"Chemical modifications of histones can mediate diverse DNA-templated processes, including gene transcription1–3. Here we provide evidence for a class of histone post-translational modification, serotonylation of glutamine, which occurs at position 5 (Q5ser) on histone H3 in organisms that produce serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)). We demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase 2 can serotonylate histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3)-marked nucleosomes, resulting in the presence of combinatorial H3K4me3Q5ser in vivo. H3K4me3Q5ser displays a ubiquitous pattern of tissue expression in mammals, with enrichment observed in brain and gut, two organ systems responsible for the bulk of 5-HT production. Genome-wide analyses of human serotonergic neurons, developing mouse brain and cultured serotonergic cells indicate that H3K4me3Q5ser nucleosomes are enriched in euchromatin, are sensitive to cellular differentiation and correlate with permissive gene expression, phenomena that are linked to the potentiation of TFIID4–6 interactions with H3K4me3. Cells that ectopically express a H3 mutant that cannot be serotonylated display significantly altered expression of H3K4me3Q5ser-target loci, which leads to deficits in differentiation. Taken together, these data identify a direct role for 5-HT, independent from its contributions to neurotransmission and cellular signalling, in the mediation of permissive gene expression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Farrelly","given":"Lorna A."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Lepack","given":"Ashley E."},{"family":"Lyu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Bhanu","given":"Natarajan V."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Baichao"},{"family":"Loh","given":"Yong-Hwee E."},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Aarthi"},{"family":"Vadodaria","given":"Krishna C."},{"family":"Heard","given":"Kelly J."},{"family":"Erikson","given":"Galina"},{"family":"Nakadai","given":"Tomoyoshi"},{"family":"Bastle","given":"Ryan M."},{"family":"Lukasak","given":"Bradley J."},{"family":"Zebroski","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Alenina","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Bader","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Berton","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Roeder","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Molina","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Gage","given":"Fred H."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Li"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Haitao"},{"family":"Muir","given":"Tom W."},{"family":"Maze","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"farrelly2019","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1024-7","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7749","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Epigenetics;Epigenetics in the nervous system;Post-translational modifications\nSubject_term_id: epigenetics;epigenetics-in-the-nervous-system;post-translational-modifications","number":"7749","page":"535-539","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Histone serotonylation is a permissive modification that enhances TFIID binding to H3K4me3","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1024-7","volume":"567"},

  {"id":"feijao2022","abstract":"The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous scaffold that is assembled between paired homologous chromosomes during the onset of meiosis. Timely expression of SC coding genes is essential for SC assembly and successful meiosis. However, SC components have an intrinsic tendency to self-organize into abnormal repetitive structures, which are not assembled between the paired homologs and whose formation is potentially deleterious for meiosis and gametogenesis. This creates an interesting conundrum, where SC genes need to be robustly expressed during meiosis, but their expression must be carefully regulated to prevent the formation of anomalous SC structures. In this manuscript, we show that the Polycomb group protein Sfmbt, the Drosophila ortholog of human MBTD1 and L3MBTL2, is required to avoid excessive expression of SC genes during prophase I. Although SC assembly is normal after Sfmbt depletion, SC disassembly is abnormal with the formation of multiple synaptonemal complexes (polycomplexes) within the oocyte. Overexpression of the SC gene corona and depletion of other Polycomb group proteins are similarly associated with polycomplex formation during SC disassembly. These polycomplexes are highly dynamic and have a well-defined periodic structure. Further confirming the importance of Sfmbt, germ line depletion of this protein is associated with significant metaphase I defects and a reduction in female fertility. Since transcription of SC genes mostly occurs during early prophase I, our results suggest a role of Sfmbt and other Polycomb group proteins in downregulating the expression of these and other early prophase I genes during later stages of meiosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Feijão","given":"Tália"},{"family":"Marques","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Rui D."},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Célia"},{"family":"Sobral","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Matos","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"António"},{"family":"Morais-de-Sá","given":"Eurico"},{"family":"Maiato","given":"Hélder"},{"family":"DeLuca","given":"Steven Z."},{"family":"Martinho","given":"Rui Gonçalo"}],"citation-key":"feijao2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2204701119","issue":"42","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]]},"page":"e2204701119","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins prevent the assembly of abnormal synaptonemal complex structures during meiosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2204701119","volume":"119"},

We show that PC and its mammalian CBX orthologs interact directly with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of CBP, binding to the previously identified autoregulatory loop, whose autoacetylation greatly enhances HAT activity. We identify a conserved PC motif adjacent to the chromodomain required for CBP binding and show that PC binding inhibits acetylation of histone H3. CBP autoacetylation impairs PC binding in vitro, and PC is preferentially associated with unacetylated CBP in vivo. PC knockdown elevates the acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac) level globally and at promoter regions of some genes that are bound by both PC and CBP. Conversely, PC overexpression decreases the H3K27ac level in vivo and also suppresses CBP-dependent Polycomb phenotypes caused by overexpression of Trithorax, an antagonist of Polycomb silencing. We find that PC is physically associated with the initiating form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and that many promoters co-occupied by PC and CBP are associated with paused Pol II, suggesting that PC may play a role in Pol II pausing. These results suggest that PC/PRC1 inhibition of CBP HAT activity plays a role in regulating transcription of both repressed and active PC-regulated genes.","author":[{"literal":"Feng Tie"},{"literal":"Rakhee Banerjee"},{"literal":"Chen Fu"},{"literal":"Carl A.

Using immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation, we find PcG proteins associated with mitotic chromosomes in Drosophila S2 cells. Genome-wide sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP–SEQ) from mitotic cells indicates that Posterior Sex Combs (PSC) is not present at well-characterized PcG targets including Hox genes in mitosis, but does remain at a subset of interphase sites. Many of these persistent sites overlap with chromatin domain borders described by Sexton et al. (2012), which are genomic regions characterized by low levels of long range contacts. Persistent PSC binding sites flank both Hox gene clusters. We hypothesize that disruption of long-range chromatin contacts in mitosis contributes to PcG protein release from most sites, while persistent binding at sites with minimal long-range contacts may nucleate re-establishment of PcG binding and chromosome organization after mitosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Follmer","given":"Nicole E."},{"family":"Wani","given":"Ajazul H."},{"family":"Francis","given":"Nicole J."}],"citation-key":"follmer2012","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003135","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003135","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A Polycomb Group Protein Is Retained at Specific Sites on Chromatin in Mitosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003135","volume":"8"},

However, different sensitivity to these two features permits each cell to respond to sinusoidal stimuli with a different preferred phase.

Epigenetic and pairing-sensitive silencing are related properties of Polycomb-group proteins, whereas their activities are generally opposed by the trithorax group. Both groups modify chromatin structure, but how their opposing activities are targeted to allow differential maintenance remains a mystery. Here, we identify a strong pairing-sensitive silencing (PSS) element at the 3′ border of the Drosophila even skipped (eve) locus. This element can maintain repression during embryonic as well as adult eye development. Transgenic dissection revealed that silencing activity depends on a binding site for the Polycomb-group protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) and on phogene function. Binding sites for the trithorax-group protein GAGA factor also contribute, whereas sites for the known Polycomb response element binding factors Zeste and Dsp1 are dispensible. Normally, eve expression in the nervous system is maintained throughout larval stages. An enhancer that functions fully in embryos does not maintain expression, but the adjacent PSS element confers maintenance. This positive activity also depends on pho gene activity and on Pho binding.

Histone modifications that are enriched at gene regulatory elements have been heavily studied, but the function of modifications found more broadly throughout the genome remains poorly understood. This is exemplified by histone H2A monoubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1), which is enriched at Polycomb-repressed gene promoters but also covers the genome at lower levels. Here, using inducible genetic perturbations and quantitative genomics, we found that the BAP1 deubiquitylase plays an essential role in constraining H2AK119ub1 throughout the genome. Removal of BAP1 leads to pervasive genome-wide accumulation of H2AK119ub1, which causes widespread reductions in gene expression. We show that elevated H2AK119ub1 preferentially counteracts Ser5 phosphorylation on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at gene regulatory elements and causes reductions in transcription and transcription-associated histone modifications. Furthermore, failure to constrain pervasive H2AK119ub1 compromises Polycomb complex occupancy at a subset of Polycomb target genes, which leads to their derepression, providing a potential molecular rationale for why the BAP1 ortholog in Drosophila has been characterized as a Polycomb group gene.

  {"id":"gaertner2012","abstract":"Poised RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is predominantly found at developmental control genes and is thought to allow their rapid and synchronous induction in response to extracellular signals. How the recruitment of poised RNA Pol II is regulated during development is not known. By isolating muscle tissue from Drosophila embryos at five stages of differentiation, we show that the recruitment of poised Pol II occurs at many genes de novo and this makes them permissive for future gene expression. A comparison with other tissues shows that these changes are stage specific and not tissue specific. In contrast, Polycomb group repression is tissue specific, and in combination with Pol II (the balanced state) marks genes with highly dynamic expression. This suggests that poised Pol II is temporally regulated and is held in check in a tissue-specific fashion.

  {"id":"gaffney2012","abstract":"Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase–seq) from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase–seq fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned—in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaffney","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"McVicker","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Pai","given":"Athma A."},{"family":"Fondufe-Mittendorf","given":"Yvonne N."},{"family":"Lewellen","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Michelini","given":"Katelyn"},{"family":"Widom","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Gilad","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Jonathan K."}],"citation-key":"gaffney2012","container-title":"PLoS Genetics","DOI":"10/f4hjwt","editor":[{"family":"Segal","given":"Eran"}],"ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003036","source":"Crossref","title":"Controls of Nucleosome Positioning in the Human Genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003036","volume":"8"},

Pioneer transcription factors are essential for remodeling the chromatin and driving the initial wave of zygotic gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, the pioneer factor Zelda is essential for development through this dramatic period of reprogramming, known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). However, it was unknown whether additional pioneer factors were required for this transition. We identified an additional maternally encoded factor required for development through the MZT, GAGA Factor (GAF). GAF is necessary to activate widespread zygotic transcription and to remodel the chromatin accessibility landscape. We demonstrated that Zelda preferentially controls expression of the earliest transcribed genes, while genes expressed during widespread activation are predominantly dependent on GAF. Thus, progression through the MZT requires coordination of multiple pioneer-like factors, and we propose that as development proceeds control is gradually transferred from Zelda to GAF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaskill","given":"Marissa M"},{"family":"Gibson","given":"Tyler J"},{"family":"Larson","given":"Elizabeth D"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Melissa M"}],"citation-key":"gaskill2021","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.66668","editor":[{"family":"Yamashita","given":"Yukiko M"},{"family":"Struhl","given":"Kevin"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,15]]},"page":"e66668","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"GAF is essential for zygotic genome activation and chromatin accessibility in the early Drosophila embryo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66668","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"gat-viks2006","abstract":"Biological systems are traditionally studied by focusing on a specific subsystem, building an intuitive model for it, and refining the model using results from carefully designed experiments. Modern experimental techniques provide massive data on the global behavior of biological systems, and systematically using these large datasets for refining existing knowledge is a major challenge. Here we introduce an extended computational framework that combines formalization of existing qualitative models, probabilistic modeling, and integration of high-throughput experimental data. Using our methods, it is possible to interpret genomewide measurements in the context of prior knowledge on the system, to assign statistical meaning to the accuracy of such knowledge, and to learn refined models with improved fit to the experiments. Our model is represented as a probabilistic factor graph, and the framework accommodates partial measurements of diverse biological elements. We study the performance of several probabilistic inference algorithms and show that hidden model variables can be reliably inferred even in the presence of feedback loops and complex logic. We show how to refine prior knowledge on combinatorial regulatory relations using hypothesis testing and derive p-values for learned model features. We test our methodology and algorithms on a simulated model and on two real yeast models. In particular, we use our method to explore uncharacterized relations among regulators in the yeast response to hyper-osmotic shock and in the yeast lysine biosynthesis system.

  {"id":"gehring1967","abstract":"Single cells were marked genetically by X-ray-induced somatic crossing over or somatic mutation in antennal disks of Drosophila larvae. The irradiated disks were cultured in adult female hosts, where the marked cell gives rise to a clone. After retransplantation into a larval host the differentiation of such clones was analyzed. It is shown that changes in determination (transdetermination) can occur in such cell clones. Thus, presumptive palp cells which normally produce their own type of cells by cell heredity, may give rise to wing cells (allotypic elements). Presumptive cells of the arista and the third antennal segment may produce tarsal cells, whereas the anlage of the second segment rarely forms any allotypic elements.

  {"id":"ghosh2022","abstract":"In many species, centromere identity is specified epigenetically by special nucleosomes containing a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, designated as CENP-A in humans and CID in Drosophila melanogaster. After partitioning of centromere-specific nucleosomes onto newly replicated sister centromeres, loading of additional CENP-A/CID into centromeric chromatin is required for centromere maintenance in proliferating cells. Analyses with cultured cells have indicated that transcription of centromeric DNA by RNA polymerase II is required for deposition of new CID into centromere chromatin. However, a dependence of centromeric CID loading on transcription is difficult to reconcile with the notion that the initial embryonic stages appear to proceed in the absence of transcription in Drosophila, as also in many other animal species. To address the role of RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription for CID loading in early Drosophila embryos, we have quantified the effects of alpha-amanitin and triptolide on centromeric CID-EGFP levels. Our analyses demonstrate that microinjection of these two potent inhibitors of RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription has at most a marginal effect on centromeric CID deposition during progression through the early embryonic cleavage cycles. Thus, we conclude that at least during early Drosophila embryogenesis, incorporation of CID into centromeres does not depend on RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Samadri"},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Christian F."}],"citation-key":"ghosh2022","container-title":"Chromosoma","container-title-short":"Chromosoma","DOI":"10.1007/s00412-022-00767-2","ISSN":"1432-0886","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Incorporation of CENP-A/CID into centromeres during early Drosophila embryogenesis does not require RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00412-022-00767-2"},

Single-cell multi-CUT&Tag profiling facilitated identification of distinct cell types from a mixed population and characterization of cell-type-specific chromatin architecture.

  {"id":"gotze2022","abstract":"The precise and rapid construction of alleles through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering renders Drosophila melanogaster a powerful animal system for molecular structure–function analyses and human disease models. Application of the ovoD co-selection method offers expedited generation and enrichment of scarlessly edited alleles without the need for linked transformation markers, which specifically in the case of exon editing can impact allele usability. However, we found that knockin procedures by homology-directed repair (HDR) under ovoD co-selection resulted in low transformation efficiency. This is likely due to repeated rounds of Cas9 cleavage of HDR donor and/or engineered genomic locus DNA, as noted for other CRISPR/Cas9 editing strategies before, impeding the recovery of correctly edited alleles. Here we provide a one-step protocol to improve the generation of scarless alleles by ovoD-co-selection with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) binding site masking. Using this workflow, we constructed human disease alleles for two Drosophila genes, unc-13/CG2999 and armadillo/CG11579. We show and quantify how a known countermeasure, the insertion of silent point mutations into protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) or sgRNA homology regions, can potently suppress unintended sequence modifications during CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of D. melanogaster under ovoD co-selection.

However, most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to stochastically generate frameshifting indels and adoption has been limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the precise incorporation of large DNA sequences, including screenable markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele. To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies that express Cas9 in the germline and directly compared HDR and off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair toward HDR. Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies yields the highest efficiency HDR and that target sites can be selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR technology for Drosophila research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gratz","given":"Scott J"},{"family":"Ukken","given":"Fiona P"},{"family":"Rubinstein","given":"C Dustin"},{"family":"Thiede","given":"Gene"},{"family":"Donohue","given":"Laura K"},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Alexander M"},{"family":"O’Connor-Giles","given":"Kate M"}],"citation-key":"gratz2014","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.113.160713","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,1]]},"page":"961-971","source":"Silverchair","title":"Highly Specific and Efficient CRISPR/Cas9-Catalyzed Homology-Directed Repair in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.113.160713","volume":"196"},

We show here that components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery are involved in PcG-mediated silencing at Fab-7 and in the production of small RNAs at transgenic Fab-7 copies. In general, these mutations do not affect the recruitment of PcG components, but they are specifically required for the maintenance of long-range contacts between Fab-7 copies. Dicer-2, PIWI, and Argonaute1, three RNAi components, frequently colocalize with PcG bodies, and their mutation significantly reduces the frequency of PcG-dependent chromosomal associations of endogenous homeotic genes.

The induced cells typically form a solid coherent mass with a distinct border between them and the remaining uninduced cells (Fig. 1a). This clean separation between induced and uninduced cells is much sharper than can readily be explained as a result of the induction process. We describe here the culture of amphibian cell and tissue recombinations in solid gels containing cytochalasin in which cell division and cell movement is inhibited during response to induction. This has revealed an effect in which the ability of a cell to respond to induction by differentiating as muscle is enhanced by, or even dependent on, other neighbouring cells differentiating in the same way at the same time.

  {"id":"gutierrez-perez2019","abstract":"Evidence suggests that Polycomb (Pc) is present at chromatin loop anchors in Drosophila. Pc is recruited to DNA through interactions with the GAGA binding factors GAF and Pipsqueak (Psq). Using HiChIP in Drosophila cells, we find that the psq gene, which has diverse roles in development and tumorigenesis, encodes distinct isoforms with unanticipated roles in genome 3D architecture. The BR-C, ttk, and bab domain (BTB)-containing Psq isoform (PsqL) colocalizes genome-wide with known architectural proteins. Conversely, Psq lacking the BTB domain (PsqS) is consistently found at Pc loop anchors and at active enhancers, including those that respond to the hormone ecdysone. After stimulation by this hormone, chromatin 3D organization is altered to connect promoters and ecdysone-responsive enhancers bound by PsqS. Our findings link Psq variants lacking the BTB domain to Pc-bound active enhancers, thus shedding light into their molecular function in chromatin changes underlying the response to hormone stimulus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gutierrez-Perez","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Rowley","given":"M.

  {"id":"gutierrez2012","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins exist in multiprotein complexes that modify chromatin to repress transcription. Drosophila PcG proteins Sex combs extra (Sce; dRing) and Posterior sex combs (Psc) are core subunits of PRC1-type complexes. The Sce:Psc module acts as an E3 ligase for monoubiquitylation of histone H2A, an activity thought to be crucial for repression by PRC1-type complexes. Here, we created an Sce knockout allele and show that depletion of Sce results in loss of H2A monoubiquitylation in developing Drosophila. Genome-wide profiling identified a set of target genes co-bound by Sce and all other PRC1 subunits. Analyses in mutants lacking individual PRC1 subunits reveals that these target genes comprise two distinct classes. Class I genes are misexpressed in mutants lacking any of the PRC1 subunits. Class II genes are only misexpressed in animals lacking the Psc-Su(z)2 and Polyhomeotic (Ph) subunits but remain stably repressed in the absence of the Sce and Polycomb (Pc) subunits. Repression of class II target genes therefore does not require Sce and H2A monoubiquitylation but might rely on the ability of Psc-Su(z)2 and Ph to inhibit nucleosome remodeling or to compact chromatin. Similarly, Sce does not provide tumor suppressor activity in larval tissues under conditions in which Psc-Su(z)2, Ph and Pc show such activity. Sce and H2A monoubiquitylation are therefore only crucial for repression of a subset of genes and processes regulated by PRC1-type complexes. Sce synergizes with the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex to repress transcription at class I genes, suggesting that H2A monoubiquitylation must be appropriately balanced for their transcriptional repression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gutiérrez","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Oktaba","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Scheuermann","given":"Johanna C."},{"family":"Gambetta","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"Ly-Hartig","given":"Nga"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"gutierrez2012","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.074450","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,1]]},"page":"117-127","source":"Silverchair","title":"The role of the histone H2A ubiquitinase Sce in Polycomb repression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.074450","volume":"139"},

In vitro experiments have shown that PcG protein complexes can compact chromatin limiting the activity of chromatin remodelling enzymes and access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. In fitting with these ideas, gene promoters associated with PcG proteins have been reported to be less accessible than other gene promotors. However, it remains largely untested in vivo whether PcG proteins define chromatin accessibility or other chromatin features. To address this important question, we measured chromatin accessibility and examined the nucleosome landscape at PcG protein-bound promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. Combined with genetic ablation strategies, we unexpectedly discover that although PcG protein-occupied gene promoters exhibit reduced accessibility, this does not rely on PcG proteins. Instead, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) appears to play a unique role in driving elevated nucleosome occupancy and decreased nucleosomal spacing in Polycomb chromatin domains. Our new genome-scale observations argue, in contrast to the prevailing view, that PcG proteins and Polycomb chromatin domains do not significantly affect chromatin accessibility and highlight an underappreciated complexity in the relationship between chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome landscape and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression.","author":[{"literal":"Hamish W.

  {"id":"harrison2011","abstract":"The earliest stages of development in most metazoans are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization, at a period known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation. To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8), during (mitotic cycle 13), and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10, we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected, early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong early association of ZLD with regions not active until the MZT suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Melissa M."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao-Yong"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Tommy"},{"family":"Botchan","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Eisen","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"harrison2011","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1002266","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e1002266","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Zelda Binding in the Early Drosophila melanogaster Embryo Marks Regions Subsequently Activated at the Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002266","volume":"7"},

We suggest that the 35-year-old DNA accessibility paradigm provides a mechanistically sound basis for understanding the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance.

Although in yeast all H3K4 methylation patterns, including H3K4me1, are implemented by Set1/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1), there are three classes of COMPASS-like complexes in Drosophila that could carry out H3K4me1 on enhancers: dSet1, Trithorax, and Trithorax-related (Trr). Here, we report that Trr, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Mll3/4 COMPASS-like complexes, can function as a major H3K4 monomethyltransferase on enhancers in vivo. Loss of Trr results in a global decrease of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels in various tissues. Assays with the cut wing margin enhancer implied a functional role for Trr in enhancer-mediated processes. A genome-wide analysis demonstrated that Trr is required to maintain the H3K4me1 and H3K27ac chromatin signature that resembles the histone modification patterns described for enhancers. Furthermore, studies in the mammalian system suggested a role for the Trr homolog Mll3 in similar processes. Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Herz","given":"Hans-Martin"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Man"},{"family":"Garruss","given":"Alexander S."},{"family":"Liang","given":"Kaiwei"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Yoh-hei"},{"family":"Mickey","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Voets","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Verrijzer","given":"C.

Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with 'Placeholder' nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 - establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hickey","given":"Graham JM"},{"family":"Wike","given":"Candice L"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Xichen"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yixuan"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Mengyao"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Patrick J"},{"family":"Cairns","given":"Bradley R"}],"citation-key":"hickey2022","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.67738","editor":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xin"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,4]]},"page":"e67738","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Establishment of developmental gene silencing by ordered polycomb complex recruitment in early zebrafish embryos","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67738","volume":"11"},

Among the least well-understood histone modifications in vivo are those that occur on the surface of the globular domain of histones, despite their causing the most profound structural alterations of the nucleosome in vitro. We utilized a Drosophila system to replace the canonical histone genes with mutated histone transgenes. Mutations predicted to mimic or prevent acetylation on histone H3 lysine (K) 56, K115, K122, and both K115/K122, or to prevent or mimic phosphorylation on H3 threonine (T) 118 and T80, all caused lethality, with the exception of K122R mutants. T118 mutations caused profound growth defects within wing discs, while K115R, K115Q, K56Q, and the K115/K122 mutations caused more subtle growth defects. The H3 K56R and H3 K122R mutations caused no defects in growth, differentiation, or transcription within imaginal discs, indicating that H3 K56 acetylation and K122 acetylation are dispensable for these functions. In agreement, we found the antibody to H3 K122Ac, which was previously used to imply a role for H3 K122Ac in transcription in metazoans, to be non-specific in vivo. Our data suggest that chromatin structural perturbations caused by acetylation of K56, K115, or K122 and phosphorylation of T80 or T118 are important for key developmental processes.","author":[{"literal":"Hillary Kristin Graves"},{"literal":"Pingping Wang"},{"literal":"Matthew Lagarde"},{"literal":"Zhihong Chen"},{"literal":"Jessica K.

In addition to posttranslational modifications of their N termini, the use of H3 variants contributes to their regulatory repertoire. Canonical histone H3.2 is expressed during S phase and differs by four amino acid residues from the variant histone H3.3, which is synthesized in a cell-cycle-independent manner [1]. Because H3.3 is enriched within actively transcribed loci [1, 2, 3], and because di- and trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 are hallmarks of chromatin at such sites in the genome [4], the H3.3K4 residue is considered to serve as the major regulatory determinant for the transcriptional state of a gene. Here we use genetic approaches in Drosophila to replace all 46 gene copies of His3.2 with mutant derivatives and thereby demonstrate that canonical and variant H3 can functionally replace each other. Cells are able to divide and differentiate when H3.2 is entirely absent but replaced by S phase-expressed H3.3. Moreover, although slowed down in their proliferative capacity, cells that code for a nonmethylatable residue instead of K4 in all canonical and variant H3 genes are competent to respond to major developmental signaling pathways by activating target gene expression. Hence, the presence of different H3 protein species is not essential in Drosophila and transcriptional regulation can occur in the complete absence of H3K4 methylation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hödl","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Basler","given":"Konrad"}],"citation-key":"hodl2012","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.008","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,4]]},"language":"en","page":"2253-2257","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Transcription in the Absence of Histone H3.2 and H3K4 Methylation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221201192X","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"hosogane2013","abstract":"Oncogenic signaling pathways regulate gene expression in part through epigenetic modification of chromatin including DNA methylation and histone modification. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27), which correlates with transcriptional repression, is regulated by an oncogenic form of the small GTPase Ras. Although accumulation of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, it remains unclear whether Ras-induced changes in H3K27me3 are a trigger for or a consequence of changes in transcriptional activity. We have now examined the relation between H3K27 trimethylation and transcriptional regulation by Ras. Genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 distribution and transcription at various times after expression of oncogenic Ras in mouse NIH 3T3 cells identified 115 genes for which H3K27me3 level at the gene body and transcription were both regulated by Ras. Similarly, 196 genes showed Ras-induced changes in transcription and H3K27me3 level in the region around the transcription start site. The Ras-induced changes in transcription occurred before those in H3K27me3 at the genome-wide level, a finding that was validated by analysis of individual genes. Depletion of H3K27me3 either before or after activation of Ras signaling did not affect the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Furthermore, given that H3K27me3 enrichment was dependent on Ras signaling, neither it nor transcriptional repression was maintained after inactivation of such signaling. Unexpectedly, we detected unannotated transcripts derived from intergenic regions at which the H3K27me3 level is regulated by Ras, with the changes in transcript abundance again preceding those in H3K27me3. Our results thus indicate that changes in H3K27me3 level in the gene body or in the region around the transcription start site are not a trigger for, but rather a consequence of, changes in transcriptional activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hosogane","given":"Masaki"},{"family":"Funayama","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Nishida","given":"Yuichiro"},{"family":"Nagashima","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Nakayama","given":"Keiko"}],"citation-key":"hosogane2013","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003698","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003698","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Ras-Induced Changes in H3K27me3 Occur after Those in Transcriptional Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003698","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"huo2022","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for post-implantation development by depositing repressive histone modifications at promoters, mainly CpG islands (CGIs), of developmental regulator genes. However, promoter PcG marks are erased after fertilization and de novo established in peri-implantation embryos, coinciding with the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for this establishment remains unknown. In this study, we show that the expression of the long KDM2B isoform (KDM2BLF), which contains the demethylase domain, is specifically induced at peri-implantation and that its H3K36me2 demethylase activity is required for PcG enrichment at CGIs.

We observe that PRC1 is highly dynamic, with only a small fraction stably interacting with chromatin. By integrating subunit-specific dynamics, chromatin binding, and abundance measurements, we discover that PRC1 exhibits low occupancy at target sites.

In Drosophila, the pioneer factor Zelda is known to be essential for the progression of development; still, it regulates the activation of only a small subset of genes at ZGA. However, thousands of genes do not require Zelda, suggesting that other mechanisms exist. By conducting GRO-seq, HiC and ChIP-seq in Drosophila embryos, we demonstrate that up to 65% of zygotically activated genes are enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z. H2A.Z enrichment precedes ZGA and RNA Polymerase II loading onto chromatin. In vivo knockdown of maternally contributed Domino, a histone chaperone and ATPase, reduces H2A.Z deposition at transcription start sites, causes global downregulation of housekeeping genes at ZGA, and compromises the establishment of the 3D chromatin structure.

  {"id":"jambhekar2019","abstract":"Histone methylation can occur at various sites in histone proteins, primarily on lysine and arginine residues, and it can be governed by multiple positive and negative regulators, even at a single site, to either activate or repress transcription. It is now apparent that histone methylation is critical for almost all stages of development, and its proper regulation is essential for ensuring the coordinated expression of gene networks that govern pluripotency, body patterning and differentiation along appropriate lineages and organogenesis. Notably, developmental histone methylation is highly dynamic. Early embryonic systems display unique histone methylation patterns, prominently including the presence of bivalent (both gene-activating and gene-repressive) marks at lineage-specific genes that resolve to monovalent marks during differentiation, which ensures that appropriate genes are expressed in each tissue type. Studies of the effects of methylation on embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation have helped to elucidate the developmental roles of histone methylation. It has been revealed that methylation and demethylation of both activating and repressive marks are essential for establishing embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, for ensuring gene dosage compensation via genomic imprinting and for establishing body patterning via HOX gene regulation. Not surprisingly, aberrant methylation during embryogenesis can lead to defects in body patterning and in the development of specific organs. Human genetic disorders arising from mutations in histone methylation regulators have revealed their important roles in the developing skeletal and nervous systems, and they highlight the overlapping and unique roles of different patterns of methylation in ensuring proper development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Jambhekar","given":"Ashwini"},{"family":"Dhall","given":"Abhinav"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yang"}],"citation-key":"jambhekar2019","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","DOI":"10.1038/s41580-019-0151-1","ISSN":"1471-0080","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 Springer Nature Limited","number":"10","page":"625-641","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Roles and regulation of histone methylation in animal development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0151-1","volume":"20"},

The perinuclear space-localized KASH domain anchors GFP to the outer nuclear membrane, and expression of UAS-GFPKASH can be controlled by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers.

PRC2 also facilitates the inheritance of this hPTM through its self-contained \"write and read\" activities, key to preserving cellular identity during cell division. As these changes in gene expression occur without changes in DNA sequence and are inherited, the process is epigenetic in scope. Mutants of mammalian PRC2 or of its histone substrate contribute to the cancer process and other diseases, and research into these aberrant pathways is yielding viable candidates for therapeutic targeting. The effectiveness of PRC2 hinges on its being recruited to the proper chromatin sites; however, resolving the determinants to this process in the mammalian case was not straightforward and thus piqued the interest of many in the field.

However, it remains largely unknown how mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is established and stably propagated during cell division. In this study, we found that the proteins RYBP and YAF2 each specifically bind H2AK119ub1 to recruit the RYBP–PRC1 or YAF2–PRC1 complex to catalyse the ubiquitination of H2A on neighbouring nucleosomes through a positive-feedback model. Additionally, we demonstrated that histone H1-compacted chromatin enhances the distal propagation of H2AK119ub1, thereby reinforcing the inheritance of H2AK119ub1 during cell division. Moreover, we showed that either disruption of RYBP/YAF2–PRC1 activity or impairment of histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction resulted in a significant defect of the maintenance of H2AK119ub1. Therefore, our results suggest that histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction plays a critical role in the stable propagation of H2AK119ub1 by RYBP/YAF2–PRC1 during cell division.

The EZL1 complex is required for histone H3 K27 and K9 methylation, heterochromatin formation, transposable element control, and programmed genome rearrangement. The EZL1 complex interacts with EMA1, a helicase required for RNA interference (RNAi). This interaction is implicated in co-transcriptional recruitment of the EZL1 complex.

First identified as dominant gain-of-function modifiers of the zeste1-white (z-w) interaction, mutant E(z) alleles also produce homeotic transformations. Reduction of E(z)+ activity leads to both suppression of the z-w interaction and ectopic expression of segment identity genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax gene complexes. This latter effect defines E(z) as a member of the Polycomb-group of genes. Analysis of E(z)S2, a temperature-sensitive E(z) allele, reveals that both maternally and zygotically produced E(z)+ activity is required to correctly regulate the segment identity genes during embryonic and imaginal development. As has been shown for other Polycomb-group genes, E(z)+ is required not to initiate the pattern of these genes, but rather to maintain their repressed state.

We find that heightened  stx  activity leads to homeotic transformation, reduced  Pc  activity, and de-repression of PcG targets. Conversely,  stx  mutants, which can be rescued by decreased  Pc  expression, display developmental defects resembling hyperactivation of  Pc . Our biochemical analyses provide a mechanistic basis for the interaction between  stx  and  Pc ; Stx facilitates Pc degradation in the proteasome, independent of ubiquitin modification. Furthermore, this mode of regulation is conserved in vertebrates.

The SUMOylation pathway influences several nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. The expression of many genes, in particular those involved in development is finely tuned in space and time by several groups of proteins. There is growing evidence that transcriptional regulation mechanisms involve direct SUMOylation of transcriptional-related proteins such as initiation and elongation factors, and subunits of chromatin modifier and remodeling complexes originally described as members of the trithorax and Polycomb groups in Drosophila. Therefore it is being unveiled that SUMOylation has a role in both, gene silencing and gene activation mechanisms. The goal of this review is to discuss the information on how SUMO modification in components of these multi-subunit complexes may have an effect in genome architecture and function and therefore in the regulation of gene expression in time and space.

Polycomb silencing of  Arabidopsis  FLOWERING LOCUS C  ( FLC ) accelerates flowering and involves a cold-dependent epigenetic switch.

The mutation blocks nucleation of plant homeodomain–Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PHD-PRC2) and indicates a role for the transcriptional repressor VAL1 in the silencing mechanism. VAL1 localizes to the nucleation region in vivo, promoting histone deacetylation and  FLC  transcriptional silencing, and interacts with components of the conserved apoptosis- and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex. Sequence-specific targeting of transcriptional repressors thus recruits the machinery for PHD-PRC2 nucleation and epigenetic silencing.","author":[{"literal":"Julia I.

The Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste has been shown in vitro to methylate specifically lysine 27 and lysine 9 of histone H3 but the role of this modification in Polycomb silencing is unknown. We show that H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 is found on the entire Ubx gene silenced by Polycomb. However, Enhancer of Zeste and other Polycomb group proteins stay primarily localized at their response elements, which appear to be the least methylated parts of the silenced gene. Our results suggest that, contrary to the prevailing view, the Polycomb group proteins and methyltransferase complexes are recruited to the Polycomb response elements independently of histone methylation and then loop over to scan the entire region, methylating all accessible nucleosomes. We propose that the Polycomb chromodomain is required for the looping mechanism that spreads methylation over a broad domain, which in turn is required for the stability of the Polycomb group protein complex.

  {"id":"kahn2014","abstract":"Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic repressors that control metazoan development and cell differentiation. In Drosophila, PcG proteins form five distinct complexes targeted to genes by Polycomb Response Elements (PREs). Of all PcG complexes PhoRC is the only one that contains a sequence-specific DNA binding subunit (PHO or PHOL), which led to a model that places PhoRC at the base of the recruitment hierarchy. Here we demonstrate that in vivo PHO is preferred to PHOL as a subunit of PhoRC and that PHO and PHOL associate with PREs and a subset of transcriptionally active promoters. Although the binding to the promoter sites depends on the quality of recognition sequences, the binding to PREs does not. Instead, the efficient recruitment of PhoRC to PREs requires the SFMBT subunit and crosstalk with Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. We find that human YY1 protein, the ortholog of PHO, binds sites at active promoters in the human genome but does not bind most PcG target genes, presumably because the interactions involved in the targeting to Drosophila PREs are lost in the mammalian lineage. We conclude that the recruitment of PhoRC to PREs is based on combinatorial interactions and propose that such a recruitment strategy is important to attenuate the binding of PcG proteins when the target genes are transcriptionally active. Our findings allow the appropriate placement of PhoRC in the PcG recruitment hierarchy and provide a rationale to explain why YY1 is unlikely to serve as a general recruiter of mammalian Polycomb complexes despite its reported ability to participate in PcG repression in flies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahn","given":"Tatyana G."},{"family":"Stenberg","given":"Per"},{"family":"Pirrotta","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Yuri B."}],"citation-key":"kahn2014","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004495","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004495","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Combinatorial Interactions Are Required for the Efficient Recruitment of Pho Repressive Complex (PhoRC) to Polycomb Response Elements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004495","volume":"10"},

They form multiple complexes of which PRC1 and PRC2 are evolutionary conserved and obligatory for repression. The targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 is poorly understood and was proposed to be hierarchical and involve tri-methylation of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and/or monoubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2AK118ub). Here, we present a strict test of this hypothesis using the Drosophila model. We discover that neither H3K27me3 nor H2AK118ub is required for targeting PRC complexes to Polycomb Response Elements (PREs). We find that PRC1 can bind PREs in the absence of PRC2 but at many PREs PRC2 requires PRC1 to be targeted. We show that one role of H3K27me3 is to allow PcG complexes anchored at PREs to interact with surrounding chromatin. In contrast, the bulk of H2AK118ub is unrelated to PcG repression.

Typically, immunostaining with antibodies provides these data. However, due to cost, time, and labor limitations, generating specific antibodies against all proteins of a complex organism is not feasible. Furthermore, antibodies do not enable live imaging studies of protein dynamics. Hence, tagging genes with standardized immunoepitopes or fluorescent tags that permit live imaging has become popular. Importantly, tagging genes present in large genomic clones or at their endogenous locus often reports proper expression, subcellular localization, and dynamics of the encoded protein. Moreover, these tagging approaches allow the generation of elegant protein removal strategies, standardization of visualization protocols, and permit protein interaction studies using mass spectrometry.

Although previously not linked to PRC2, we confirmed direct binding of Scm and PRC2 using recombinant protein expression and colocalization of Scm with PRC1, PRC2, and H3K27me3 in embryos and cultured cells using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing). Furthermore, we found that RNAi knockdown of Scm and overexpression of the dominant-negative Scm-SAM (sterile α motif) domain both affected the binding pattern of E(z) on polytene chromosomes. Aberrant localization of the Scm-SAM domain in long contiguous regions on polytene chromosomes revealed its independent ability to spread on chromatin, consistent with its previously described ability to oligomerize in vitro. Pull-downs of BioTAP-Scm captured PRC1 and PRC2 and additional repressive complexes, including PhoRC, LINT, and CtBP. We propose that Scm is a key mediator connecting PRC1, PRC2, and transcriptional silencing.

Since PcG and TrxG are ubiquitous and lack apparent sequence specificity, a long-standing model is that targeting occurs via protein interactions; for instance, between repressors and PcG proteins. Instead, we found that Pc-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) purifies with coactivators Fs(1)h [female sterile (1) homeotic] and Enok/Br140 during embryogenesis.

Enok and Br140, another bromodomain protein, are orthologous to subunits of a mammalian MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase complex. Here we confirm PRC1–Br140 and PRC1–Fs(1)h interactions and identify their genomic binding sites. PRC1–Br140 bind developmental genes in fly embryos, with analogous co-occupancy of PRC1 and a Br140 ortholog, BRD1, at bivalent loci in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We propose that identification of PRC1–Br140 “bivalent complexes” in fly embryos supports and extends the bivalency model posited in mammalian cells, in which the coexistence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at developmental promoters represents a poised transcriptional state.

  {"id":"karolinapyziak2021","abstract":"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is commonly overexpressed or mutated in many cancer types, both of hematological and solid nature. Till now, plenty of EZH2 small molecule inhibitors have been developed and some of them have already been tested in clinical trials. Most of these inhibitors, however, are effective only in limited cases in the context of EZH2 gain-of-function mutated tumors such as lymphomas. Other cancer types with aberrant EZH2 expression and function require alternative approaches for successful treatment. One possibility is to exploit synthetic lethal strategy, which is based on the phenomenon that concurrent loss of two genes is detrimental but the deletion of either of them leaves cell viable. In the context of EZH2/PRC2, the most promising synthetic lethal target seems to be SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable chromatin remodeling complex (SWI/SNF), which is known to counteract PRC2 functions. SWI/SNF is heavily involved in carcinogenesis and its subunits have been found mutated in approximately 20% of tumors of different kinds. In the current review, we summarize the existing knowledge of synthetic lethal relationships between EZH2/PRC2 and components of the SWI/SNF complex and discuss in detail the potential application of existing EZH2 inhibitors in cancer patients harboring mutations in SWI/SNF proteins. We also highlight recent discoveries of EZH2 involvement in tumor microenvironment regulation and consequences for future therapies. Although clinical studies are limited, the fundamental research might help to understand which patients are most likely to benefit from therapies using EZH2 inhibitors.","author":[{"literal":"Karolina Pyziak"},{"literal":"Agnieszka Sroka-Porada"},{"literal":"Tomasz Rzymski"},{"literal":"Tomasz Rzymski"},{"literal":"Jozef Dulak"},{"literal":"Agnieszka Łoboda"}],"citation-key":"karolinapyziak2021","container-title":"Drug Development Research","container-title-short":"Drug Development Research","DOI":"10.1002/ddr.21796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"title":"Potential of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitors for the treatment of SWI/SNF mutant cancers and tumor microenvironment modulation.","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"karpen1981","abstract":"Every organism develops body patterns that are accurately repeated among individuals of the same species. To understand how cells interact to form these patterns, many investigators have studied the re-establishment of patterns following genetic and/or physical perturbations. In regulating systems, missing structures may be replaced by cell proliferation (epimorphosis) or by respecification without growth (morphallaxis)1. Epimorphosis involves the formation and growth of a blastema2, defined for vertebrate regeneration as a zone of proliferating cells, localized near the wound surface3, which becomes capable of regenerating even when isolated from the rest of the limb4. Clonal analysis of Drosophila imaginal disk fragments indicates that during pattern regulation most dividing cells are located near the wound surface5. Furthermore, mitotic figures (L. C. Abbott, personal communication) and cells incorporating 3H-thymidine6 are clustered near the wound surface of regulating fragments. Here we describe experiments involving cultures of this zone of proliferating cells, and report that it can regulate in isolation. These observations provide evidence that regulation of disk fragments is accomplished by growth of a blastema. Surprisingly, the isolated blastema regenerated more pattern elements than predicted by the polar coordinate model7. We resolve this paradox by proposing that regulation is initiated at free cut edges, where a blastema is formed that adds new positional values in a sequence. On completion of wound healing, blastema growth continues until remaining positional disparities are eliminated by intercalation, as presented in the polar coordinate model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Karpen","given":"Gary H."},{"family":"Schubiger","given":"Gerold"}],"citation-key":"karpen1981","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/294744a0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"5843","issued":{"date-parts":[[1981,12]]},"language":"en","license":"1981 Nature Publishing Group","number":"5843","page":"744-747","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Extensive regulatory capabilities of a Drosophila imaginal disk blastema","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/294744a0","volume":"294"},

  {"id":"kassis1994","abstract":"We have previously shown that a 2-kb fragment of engrailed DNA can suppress expression of a linked marker gene, white, in the P element vector CaSpeR. This suppression is dependent on the presence of two copies of engrailed DNA-containing P elements (P[en]) in proximity in the Drosophila genome (either in cis or in trans). In this study, the 2-kb fragment was dissected and found to contain three fragments of DNA which could mediate white suppression [called \"pairing-sensitive sites\" (PS)]. A PS site was also identified in regulatory DNA from the Drosophila escargot gene. The eye colors of six different P[en] insertions in the escargot gene suggest an interaction between P[en]-encoded and genome-encoded PS sites. I hypothesize that white gene expression from P[en] is repressed by the formation of a protein complex which is initiated at the engrailed PS sites and also requires interactions with flanking genomic DNA. Genes were sought which influence the function of PS sites. Mutations in some Polycomb and trithorax group genes were found to affect the eye color from some P[en] insertion sites. However, different mutations affected expression from different P[en] insertion sites and no one mutation was found to affect expression from all P[en] insertion sites examined. These results suggest that white expression from P[en] is not directly regulated by members of the Polycomb and trithorax group genes, but in some cases can be influenced by them. I propose that engrailed PS sites normally act to promote interactions between distantly located engrailed regulatory sites and the engrailed promoter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kassis","given":"J A"}],"citation-key":"kassis1994","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/genetics/136.3.1025","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,3,1]]},"page":"1025-1038","source":"Silverchair","title":"Unusual properties of regulatory DNA from the Drosophila engrailed gene: three \"pairing-sensitive\" sites within a 1.6-kb region.","title-short":"Unusual properties of regulatory DNA from the Drosophila engrailed gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/136.3.1025","volume":"136"},

  {"id":"kassis2013","abstract":"Polycomb group genes (PcG) encode a group of about 16 proteins that were first identified in Drosophila as repressors of homeotic genes. PcG proteins are present in all metazoans and are best characterized as transcriptional repressors. In Drosophila, these proteins are known as epigenetic regulators because they remember, but do not establish, the patterned expression state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins, in general, are not DNA binding proteins, but act in protein complexes to repress transcription at specific target genes. How are PcG proteins recruited to the DNA? In Drosophila, there are specific regulatory DNA elements called Polycomb group response elements (PREs) that bring PcG protein complexes to the DNA. Drosophila PREs are made up of binding sites for a complex array of DNA binding proteins. Functional PRE assays in transgenes have shown that PREs act in the context of other regulatory DNA and PRE activity is highly dependent on genomic context. Drosophila PREs tend to regulate genes with a complex array of regulatory DNA in a cell or tissue-specific fashion and it is the interplay between regulatory DNA that dictates PRE function. In mammals, PcG proteins are more diverse and there are multiple ways to recruit PcG complexes, including RNA-mediated recruitment. In this review, we discuss evidence for PREs in vertebrates and explore similarities and differences between Drosophila and vertebrate PREs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kassis","given":"Judith A."},{"family":"Brown","given":"J.

It remains unclear whether and how transcriptional condensates accelerate the search of transcriptional regulatory factors for their target sites. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which regulatory factors nucleate on chromatin to assemble transcriptional condensates remain incompletely understood. The CBX-PRC1 complexes compartmentalize key developmental regulators for repression through phase-separated condensates driven by the chromobox 2 (CBX2) protein. Here, by using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we show that CBX2 nucleates on chromatin independently of H3K27me3 and CBX-PRC1. The interactions between CBX2 and DNA are essential for nucleating CBX-PRC1 on chromatin to assemble condensates. The assembled condensates shorten 3D diffusion time and reduce trials for finding specific sites through revisiting the same or adjacent sites repetitively, thereby accelerating CBX2 in searching for target sites. Overall, our data suggest a generic mechanism by which transcriptional regulatory factors nucleate to assemble condensates that accelerate their target-search process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kent","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chou-hsun"},{"family":"Alsaihati","given":"Njood"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haobin"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiaojun"}],"citation-key":"kent2020","container-title":"Cell Reports","container-title-short":"Cell Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108248","ISSN":"2211-1247","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,13]]},"language":"en","page":"108248","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Phase-Separated Transcriptional Condensates Accelerate Target-Search Process Revealed by Live-Cell Single-Molecule Imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720312377","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"king2018","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that play important roles in regulating gene expression during animal development. In vitro experiments have shown that PcG protein complexes can compact chromatin to limit the activity of chromatin remodeling enzymes and access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. In fitting with these ideas, gene promoters associated with PcG proteins have been reported to be less accessible than other gene promoters. However, it remains largely untested in vivo whether PcG proteins define chromatin accessibility or other chromatin features. To address this important question, we examine the chromatin accessibility and nucleosome landscape at PcG protein-bound promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. Combined with genetic ablation strategies, we unexpectedly discover that although PcG protein-occupied gene promoters exhibit reduced accessibility, this does not rely on PcG proteins. Instead, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) appears to play a unique role in driving elevated nucleosome occupancy and decreased nucleosomal spacing in Polycomb chromatin domains. Our new genome-scale observations argue, in contrast to the prevailing view, that PcG proteins do not significantly affect chromatin accessibility and highlight an underappreciated complexity in the relationship between chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome landscape, and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Hamish W."},{"family":"Fursova","given":"Nadezda A."},{"family":"Blackledge","given":"Neil P."},{"family":"Klose","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"king2018","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.237180.118","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1494-1507","PMID":"30154222","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Polycomb repressive complex 1 shapes the nucleosome landscape but not accessibility at target genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/28/10/1494","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"klein1999","abstract":"The vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila plays a central role in the development and patterning of the wing: loss of vestigial results in failures in wing development and ectopic expression of vestigial leads to the development of ectopic wings. The wing-specific regulation of vestigial is mediated through two enhancers: (1) the Boundary Enhancer (vgBE) is early acting and becomes restricted to the wing margin, and (2) the Quadrant Enhancer (vgQE), acts later and is responsible for the expression of vestigial in the developing wing blade. These enhancers receive regulatory inputs from three signalling pathways: wingless, decapentaplegic and Notch/Suppressor of Hairless. Our experiments show that the vestigial gene product is also an input in the regulation of vestigial expression. In particular, Vestigial provides an important input for the regulation of the activity of the vgQE acting in concert with Wingless and Decapentaplegic. Our results suggest how interactions between vgBE and the vgQE mediated by Vestigial can explain the interactions between the wing margin and the wing blade during the growth of the wing. We further show that Vestigial and Notch collaborate with Wingless to subdivide and pattern the wing blade. These results lead us to propose a general role for Wingless during development in which it stabilizes cell fate decisions that have been implemented by other molecules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Klein","given":"T."},{"family":"Arias","given":"A.M."}],"citation-key":"klein1999","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.126.5.913","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,3,1]]},"page":"913-925","source":"Silverchair","title":"The vestigial gene product provides a molecular context for the interpretation of signals during the development of the wing in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.126.5.913","volume":"126"},

The trxG proteins Ash1 and hTRX and the PcG repressor E(z) are histone methyltransferases (HMTases) that methylate distinct lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histone H3. trxG proteins are generally thought to function as activators of HOX genes, but how histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx promotes HOX gene transcription is not clear. Here, we show that in ash1 and trx mutants expression of HOX genes is lost within their normal expression domains, but we find that, contrary to expectation, this expression is restored in ash1 and trx mutants that also lack PcG gene function. Moreover, such trxG PcG double mutants show severe misexpression of HOX genes and, hence, ectopic activation of HOX genes caused by the removal of PcG gene function also occurs in the absence of ash1 and trx function. Together, these results suggest that the Ash1 and Trx HMTases are not ?coactivators? required for transcriptional activation of HOX genes, but function specifically as anti-repressors. We propose that histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx is required continuously throughout development to prevent inappropriate PcG silencing of HOX genes in cells in which they must stay transcriptionally active.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Klymenko","given":"Tetyana"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"klymenko2004","container-title":"EMBO reports","DOI":"10.1038/sj.embor.7400111","ISSN":"1469-221X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,4,1]]},"page":"373-377","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"embopress.org (Atypon)","title":"The histone methyltransferases Trithorax and Ash1 prevent transcriptional silencing by Polycomb group proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/sj.embor.7400111","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"klymenko2006","abstract":"Polycomb response elements (PREs) are specific cis-regulatory sequences needed for transcriptional repression of HOX and other target genes by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Among the many PcG proteins known in Drosophila, Pho is the only sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. To gain insight into the function of Pho, we purified Pho protein complexes from Drosophila embryos and found that Pho exists in two distinct protein assemblies: a Pho–dINO80 complex containing the Drosophila INO80 nucleosome-remodeling complex, and a Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) containing the uncharacterized gene product dSfmbt. Analysis of PhoRC reveals that dSfmbt is a novel PcG protein that is essential for HOX gene repression in Drosophila. PhoRC is bound at HOX gene PREs in vivo, and this targeting strictly depends on Pho-binding sites. Characterization of dSfmbt protein shows that its MBT repeats have unique discriminatory binding activity for methylated lysine residues in histones H3 and H4; the MBT repeats bind mono- and di-methylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 but fail to interact with these residues if they are unmodified or tri-methylated. Our results establish PhoRC as a novel Drosophila PcG protein complex that combines DNA-targeting activity (Pho) with a unique modified histone-binding activity (dSfmbt). We propose that PRE-tethered PhoRC selectively interacts with methylated histones in the chromatin flanking PREs to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Klymenko","given":"Tetyana"},{"family":"Papp","given":"Bernadett"},{"family":"Fischle","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Köcher","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Schelder","given":"Malgorzata"},{"family":"Fritsch","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Wild","given":"Brigitte"},{"family":"Wilm","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"klymenko2006","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.377406","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1110-1122","PMID":"16618800","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"A Polycomb group protein complex with sequence-specific DNA-binding and selective methyl-lysine-binding activities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/9/1110","volume":"20"},

The Drosophila melanogaster genome has a single locus comprised of ∼100 copies of a tandemly arrayed 5-kB repeat unit containing one copy of each of the 5 RD histone genes. To determine sequence elements required for D. melanogaster HLB formation and histone gene expression, we used transgenic gene arrays containing 12 copies of the histone repeat unit that functionally complement loss of the ∼200 endogenous RD histone genes. A 12x histone gene array in which all H3-H4 promoters were replaced with H2a-H2b promoters (12xPR) does not form an HLB or express high levels of RD histone mRNA in the presence of the endogenous histone genes. In contrast, this same transgenic array is active in HLB assembly and RD histone gene expression in the absence of the endogenous RD histone genes and rescues the lethality caused by homozygous deletion of the RD histone locus. The HLB formed in the absence of endogenous RD histone genes on the mutant 12x array contains all known factors present in the wild-type HLB including CLAMP, which normally binds to GAGA repeats in the H3-H4 promoter. These data suggest that multiple protein–protein and/or protein–DNA interactions contribute to HLB formation, and that the large number of endogenous RD histone gene copies sequester available factor(s) from attenuated transgenic arrays, thereby preventing HLB formation and gene expression on these arrays.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Koreski","given":"Kaitlin P."},{"family":"Rieder","given":"Leila E."},{"family":"McLain","given":"Lyndsey M."},{"family":"Chaubal","given":"Ashlesha"},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"William F."},{"family":"Duronio","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"koreski2020","container-title":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","container-title-short":"MBoC","DOI":"10.1091/mbc.E20-03-0176","editor":[{"family":"Misteli","given":"Tom"}],"ISSN":"1059-1524, 1939-4586","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1525-1537","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"<i>Drosophila</i> histone locus body assembly and function involves multiple interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E20-03-0176","volume":"31"},

Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented.

To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes—the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding.

The mechanism by which RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes the nucleosomal DNA remains unclear. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of RNAPII-nucleosome complexes in which RNAPII pauses at the superhelical locations SHL(−6), SHL(−5), SHL(−2), and SHL(−1) of the nucleosome. RNAPII pauses at the major histone-DNA contact sites, and the nucleosome interactions with the RNAPII subunits stabilize the pause. These structures reveal snapshots of nucleosomal transcription, in which RNAPII gradually tears DNA from the histone surface while preserving the histone octamer. The nucleosomes in the SHL(−1) complexes are bound to a “foreign” DNA segment, which might explain the histone transfer mechanism.

Some PcG proteins covalently modify histones, which contributes to heritable repression. The role for other effects on chromatin structure is less understood. We characterized the organization of PcG target genes in ESCs and neural progenitors using 5C and super-resolution microscopy. The genomic loci of repressed PcG targets formed discrete, small (20–140 Kb) domains of tight interaction that corresponded to locations bound by canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). These domains changed during differentiation as PRC1 binding changed. Their formation depended upon the Polyhomeotic component of canonical PRC1 and occurred independently of PRC1-catalyzed ubiquitylation. PRC1 domains differ from topologically associating domains in size and boundary characteristics. These domains have the potential to play a key role in transmitting epigenetic silencing of PcG targets by linking PRC1 to formation of a repressive higher-order structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kundu","given":"Sharmistha"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Sunwoo","given":"Hongjae"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Gaurav"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jeannie T."},{"family":"Sadreyev","given":"Ruslan I."},{"family":"Dekker","given":"Job"},{"family":"Kingston","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"kundu2017","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2017.01.009","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,2]]},"language":"en","page":"432-446.e5","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 Generates Discrete Compacted Domains that Change during Differentiation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276517300357","volume":"65"},

  {"id":"kurzhals2008","abstract":"The Drosophila esc-like gene (escl) encodes a protein very similar to ESC. Like ESC, ESCL binds directly to the E(Z) histone methyltransferase via its WD region. In contrast to ESC, which is present at highest levels during embryogenesis and low levels thereafter, ESCL is continuously present throughout development and in adults. ESC/E(Z) complexes are present at high levels mainly during embryogenesis but ESCL/E(Z) complexes are found throughout development. While depletion of either ESCL or ESC by RNAi in S2 and Kc cells has little effect on E(Z)-mediated methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), simultaneous depletion of ESCL and ESC results in loss of di- and trimethyl-H3K27, indicating that either ESC or ESCL is necessary and sufficient for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 in vivo. While E(Z) complexes in S2 cells contain predominantly ESC, in ESC-depleted S2 cells, ESCL levels rise dramatically and ESCL replaces ESC in E(Z) complexes. A mutation in escl that produces very little protein is viable and exhibits no phenotypes but strongly enhances esc mutant phenotypes, suggesting they have similar functions. esc escl double homozygotes die at the end of the larval period, indicating that the well-known “maternal rescue” of esc homozygotes requires ESCL. Furthermore, maternal and zygotic over-expression of escl fully rescues the lethality of esc null mutant embryos that contain no ESC protein, indicating that ESCL can substitute fully for ESC in vivo. These data thus indicate that ESC and ESCL play similar if not identical functions in E(Z) complexes in vivo. Despite this, when esc is expressed normally, escl appears to be entirely dispensable, at least for development into morphologically normal fertile adults. Furthermore, the larval lethality of esc escl double mutants, together with the lack of phenotypes in the escl mutant, further suggests that in wild-type (esc+) animals it is the post-embryonic expression of esc, not escl, that is important for development of normal adults. Thus escl appears to function in a backup capacity during development that becomes important only when normal esc expression is compromised.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kurzhals","given":"Rebeccah L."},{"family":"Tie","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Stratton","given":"Carl A."},{"family":"Harte","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"kurzhals2008","container-title":"Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.10.025","ISSN":"0012-1606","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"293-306","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Drosophila ESC-like can substitute for ESC and becomes required for Polycomb silencing if ESC is absent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160607014704","volume":"313"},

Here, we describe a novel mode of histone crosstalk during gene silencing, in which histone H2A monoubiquitylation is coupled to the removal of histone H3 Lys 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). This pathway was uncovered through the identification of dRING-associated factors (dRAF), a novel Polycomb group (PcG) silencing complex harboring the histone H2A ubiquitin ligase dRING, PSC and the F-box protein, and demethylase dKDM2. In vivo, dKDM2 shares many transcriptional targets with Polycomb and counteracts the histone methyltransferases TRX and ASH1. Importantly, cellular depletion and in vitro reconstitution assays revealed that dKDM2 not only mediates H3K36me2 demethylation but is also required for efficient H2A ubiquitylation by dRING/PSC. Thus, dRAF removes an active mark from histone H3 and adds a repressive one to H2A.

  {"id":"laprell2017","abstract":"DNA sequence and inherited gene silencing\nCell fate decisions require a gene's transcriptional status, whether on or off, to be stably and heritably maintained over multiple cell generations. For silenced genes, heterochromatin domains are associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications, and these histone marks are maintained during DNA replication and chromosome duplication (see the Perspective by De and Kassis). Laprell et al. show that parental methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) nucleosomes in Drosophila are inherited in daughter cells after replication and can repress transcription, but that they are not sufficient to propagate the mark. Trimethylation of newly incorporated nucleosomes requires recruitment of the methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to neighboring cis-regulatory DNA elements. Coleman and Struhl demonstrate that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting epigenetic memory at a Drosophila HOX gene through anchoring of PRC2 at the Polycomb response element binding site. Wang and Moazed examine fission yeast and show that both sequence-dependent and chromodomain sequence-independent mechanisms are required for stable epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications and the epigenetic maintenance of silencing. These studies highlight the crucial role of DNA binding for heritable gene silencing during growth and development.\nScience, this issue p. 85, p. eaai8236, p. 88; see also p. 28\nEpigenetic inheritance models posit that during Polycomb repression, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) propagates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) independently of DNA sequence. We show that insertion of Polycomb response element (PRE) DNA into the Drosophila genome creates extended domains of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin and causes repression of a linked reporter gene. After excision of PRE DNA, H3K27me3 nucleosomes become diluted with each round of DNA replication, and reporter gene repression is lost.

  {"id":"larson2022","abstract":"Following fertilization, the uniﬁed germ cells rapidly transition to a totipotent embryo. Maternally deposited mRNAs encode the proteins necessary for this reprogramming as the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally quiescent during the initial stages of development. The transcription factors required to activate the zygotic genome are among these maternally deposited mRNAs and are robustly translated following fertilization. In Drosophila, the mRNA encoding Zelda, the major activator of the zygotic genome, is not translated until 1 h after fertilization. Here we demonstrate that zelda translation is repressed in the early embryo by the TRIM-NHL protein Brain tumor (BRAT). BRAT also regulates Zelda levels in the larval neuroblast lineage. In the embryo, BRAT-mediated translational repression is regulated by the Pan Gu kinase, which is triggered by egg activation. The Pan Gu kinase phosphorylates translational regulators, suggesting that Pan Gu kinase activity alleviates translational repression of zelda by BRAT and coupling translation of zelda with that of other regulators of early embryonic development. Using the premature translation of zelda in embryos lacking BRAT activity, we showed that early translation of a zygotic genome activator is not sufﬁcient to drive precocious gene expression. Instead, Zelda-target genes showed increased expression at the time they are normally activated. We propose that transition through early development requires the integration of multiple processes, including the slowing of the nuclear division cycle and activation of the zygotic genome. These processes are coordinately controlled by Pan Gu kinase-mediated regulation of translation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Larson","given":"Elizabeth D"},{"family":"Komori","given":"Hideyuki"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Zoe A"},{"family":"Krabbenhoft","given":"Samuel D"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Cheng-Yu"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Melissa"}],"citation-key":"larson2022","container-title":"G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/g3journal/jkac159","editor":[{"family":"Lott","given":"S"}],"ISSN":"2160-1836","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,25]]},"language":"en","page":"jkac159","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Premature translation of the <i>Drosophila</i> zygotic genome activator Zelda is not sufficient to precociously activate gene expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/doi/10.1093/g3journal/jkac159/6649735","volume":"12"},

We show that H2A.Z.1(K3R3) is properly incorporated at target promoters in murine ESCs (mESCs), but loss of monoubiquitylation leads to de-repression of bivalent genes, loss of Polycomb binding, and faulty lineage commitment. Using quantitative proteomics, we find that tandem bromodomain proteins, including the BET family member BRD2, are enriched in H2A.Z.1 chromatin. We further show that BRD2 is gained at de-repressed promoters in H2A.Z.1(K3R3) mESCs, whereas BRD2 inhibition restores gene silencing at these sites.

Here we present engineered mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) targeting the PRC2 subunits EZH1 and EZH2 to discriminate between contributions of distinct H3K27 methylation states and the presence of PRC2/1 at chromatin. We generate catalytically inactive EZH2 mutant ESCs, demonstrating that H3K27 methylation, but not recruitment to the chromatin, is essential for proper ESC differentiation. We further show that EZH1 activity is sufficient to maintain repression of Polycomb targets by depositing H3K27me2/3 and preserving PRC1 recruitment. This occurs in the presence of altered H3K27me1 deposition at actively transcribed genes and by a diffused hyperacetylation of chromatin that compromises ESC developmental potential.

Typically, Polycomb response elements (PRE) that direct PcG repression are located at great distances (10s of kb) from the promoters of PcG-repressed genes, and it is not known how these PREs can communicate with promoters over such distances. Using Class II mouse PRC core complexes (mPCCs) assembled from recombinant subunits, we investigated how PcG complexes might bridge distant chromosomal regions. Like native and recombinant Drosophila Class II complexes, mPCC represses chromatin remodeling and transcription. Interestingly, mPCC bound to one polynucleosome template can recruit a second template from solution and renders it refractory to transcription and chromatin remodeling. A Drosophila PRC core complex (dPCC) also is able to recruit a second template. Posterior sex combs (PSC), a subunit of dPCC, inhibits chromatin remodeling and transcription efficiently but requires assembly with dRING1 to recruit chromatin. Thus, repression and template bridging require different subunits of PcG complexes, suggesting that long-range effects may be mechanistically distinct from repression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lavigne","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Francis","given":"Nicole J."},{"family":"King","given":"Ian F.

  {"id":"leatham-jensen2019","abstract":"Proper determination of cell fates depends on epigenetic information that is used to preserve memory of decisions made earlier in development. Post-translational modification of histone residues is thought to be a central means by which epigenetic information is propagated. In particular, modifications of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are strongly correlated with both gene activation and gene repression. H3K27 acetylation is found at sites of active transcription, whereas H3K27 methylation is found at loci silenced by Polycomb group proteins. The histones bearing these modifications are encoded by the replication-dependent H3 genes as well as the replication-independent H3.3 genes. Owing to differential rates of nucleosome turnover, H3K27 acetylation is enriched on replication-independent H3.3 histones at active gene loci, and H3K27 methylation is enriched on replication-dependent H3 histones across silenced gene loci. Previously, we found that modification of replicationdependent H3K27 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing, but it is not required for gene activation. However, the contribution of replication-independent H3.3K27 to these functions is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the endogenous replicationindependent H3.3K27 to a non-modifiable residue. Surprisingly, we find that H3.3K27 is also required for Polycomb target gene silencing despite the association of H3.3 with active transcription. However, the requirement for H3.3K27 comes at a later stage of development than that found for replication-dependent H3K27, suggesting a greater reliance on replication-independent H3.3K27 in post-mitotic cells. Notably, we find no evidence of global transcriptional defects in H3.3K27 mutants, despite the strong correlation between H3.3K27 acetylation and active transcription.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Leatham-Jensen","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Uyehara","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Strahl","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Matera","given":"A.

  {"id":"lee2005","abstract":"During the regeneration of Drosophila imaginal discs, cellular identities can switch fate in a process known as transdetermination1. For leg-to-wing transdetermination, the underlying mechanism involves morphogens such as Wingless that, when activated outside their normal context, induce ectopic expression of the wing-specific selector gene vestigial2,3. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain cellular fates by controlling the expression patterns of homeotic genes and other developmental regulators4. Here we report that transdetermination events are coupled to PcG regulation. We show that the frequency of transdetermination is enhanced in PcG mutant flies. Downregulation of PcG function, as monitored by the reactivation of a silent PcG-regulated reporter gene, is observed in transdetermined cells. This downregulation is directly controlled by theJun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway, which is activated in cells undergoing regeneration. Accordingly, transdetermination frequency is reduced in a JNK mutant background. This regulatory interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, indicating that the role of this signalling cascade in remodelling cellular fates may be conserved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Nara"},{"family":"Maurange","given":"Cédric"},{"family":"Ringrose","given":"Leonie"},{"family":"Paro","given":"Renato"}],"citation-key":"lee2005","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature04120","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7065","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2005 Nature Publishing Group","number":"7065","page":"234-237","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Suppression of Polycomb group proteins by JNK signalling induces transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04120","volume":"438"},

We show that H3K27me2 occurs in inverse proportion to transcriptional activity in most non-PcG target genes and intergenic regions and is governed by opposing roaming activities of PRC2 and complexes containing the H3K27 demethylase UTX. Surprisingly, loss of H3K27me2 results in global transcriptional derepression proportionally greatest in silent or weakly transcribed intergenic and genic regions and accompanied by an increase of H3K27ac and H3K4me1. H3K27me2 therefore sets a threshold that prevents random, unscheduled transcription all over the genome and even limits the activity of highly transcribed genes. PRC1-type complexes also have global roles. Unexpectedly, we find a pervasive distribution of histone H2A ubiquitylated at lysine 118 (H2AK118ub) outside of canonical PcG target regions, dependent on the RING/Sce subunit of PRC1-type complexes.

Especially the switch to flowering is important for plants because it allows (sexual) reproduction, and should not occur unless the conditions are right. External and internal signals are relayed via FT/TFL1 genes; genes with a great impact on flowering time. The PRC1/PRC2 system plays an important role in the repression of flowering, indicated by the aberrant flowering phenotype of its mutants. Via deposition of histone modifications H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 it keeps genes stably silenced, so that transitions and responses do not happen as a result of random fluctuations in the internal or external environment. \n\nIn the first manuscript we focussed on PRC2-component MSI1 in Arabidopsis. MSI1 is the nucleosome-binding core component of PRC2 and other chromatin-modifying complexes. We found that MSI1 is also a core part of a histone de-acetylase complex together with histone de-acetylase HDA19. We further found that this complex represses the ABA-mediated salt stress response by de-acetylating the ABA receptors.\n\nThe second manuscript focused on flowering time in the invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia. During the last couple of centuries it invaded Europe, where it currently thrives mostly in the south-east. Earlier flowering populations have since been found in the north, suggesting local adaptation. We studied this early-flowering trait and found that it is inherited dominantly, and that it is maladaptive under long vegetation periods. We also identified the FT/TFL1 genes in this species, and found that a combination of expression changes in the FT-like floral activator and TFL1-like floral repressor likely underlies the altered flowering time.\n\nIn the third manuscript we tried to shed light on repressive H2A de-ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Previously, it has been observed that loss of UBP12/13-mediated H2A deubiquitination causes loss of H3K27me3 and re-activation of some PRC2 targets. We show now that this holds true on a genome-wide level, and that the genes targeted by UBP12/13 are those affected in H3K27me3 maintenance and expression. We also showed that H2Aub1 not only recruits PRC2, but likely also recruits H3K27 demethylase REF6. We show that H2Aub1 therefore puts genes in a state responsive to stimuli, and that stable repression requires its removal.","author":[{"literal":"Lejon Kralemann"}],"citation-key":"lejonkralemann2019","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of flowering time","type":"article-journal"},

In this respect, CRMs function as instructional platforms for the assembly of gene regulatory complexes. We discuss multiple mechanisms controlling complex assembly, including cooperative DNA binding, combinatorial codes, and CRM architecture. The second section of this review places CRM assembly in the context of nucleosomes and condensed chromatin. We discuss how DNA accessibility and histone modiﬁcations contribute to TF function. Lastly, new advances in chromosomal mapping techniques have provided increased understanding of intra- and interchromosomal interactions.

  {"id":"li-kroeger","abstract":"We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in Drosophila. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping in vivo based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications., Organisms have tens of thousands of genes, but finding out exactly what they all do is one of the greatest challenges of modern genetics. To understand a gene’s job, it’s necessary to find out what gene is active in which tissue, where their proteins are located within the cell, and what happens when the sequence of a gene is altered or removed. This multi-step process of ‘annotating’ genes can be challenging in practice., One common approach is to make use of a DNA pattern called a MiMIC and insert it in a specific part of the gene called an intron. A tag for a protein that glows green under the microscope can then be added to a MiMIC to help visualize where and when the protein is being expressed. MiMICs can also be used to integrate a system called T2A-GAL4, which typically creates a severe mutation in the gene and allows to track the timing of when and where the gene is expressed. This helps to discover the role of the gene in cells and tissues. However, a problem with this approach is that when either the protein tag or the T2A-GAL4 system is added, half of the time they point into the wrong direction. This is because each DNA strand is read in one direction only., Now, Li-Kroeger et al. created a so-called ‘Double Header’ system, which includes T2A-GAL4 coding in one direction and the protein tag in the other. Therefore, when the system integrates, there will always be one tag pointing in the correct direction. This makes the system twice as efficient., Not all genes have introns though. To access genes that do not contain introns, Li-Kroeger et al. developed another system, which uses the genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a different kind of visible marker. Here, the whole gene is typically removed and replaced by a visible marker, which can then be replaced by any DNA, including protein tags and the T2A-GAL4 system., With these approaches, all genes in the fruit fly can now be targeted. The systems perform several tasks, including detecting gene activity and the location of proteins in the cell, and analyzing the role of the protein. The findings will be relevant to researchers interested in fruit fly genetics and cell function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Li-Kroeger","given":"David"},{"family":"Kanca","given":"Oguz"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Pei-Tseng"},{"family":"Cowan","given":"Sierra"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Michael T"},{"family":"Jaiswal","given":"Manish"},{"family":"Salazar","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"He","given":"Yuchun"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"Zhongyuan"},{"family":"Bellen","given":"Hugo J"}],"citation-key":"li-kroeger","container-title":"eLife","container-title-short":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.38709","ISSN":"2050-084X","page":"e38709","PMCID":"PMC6095692","PMID":"30091705","source":"PubMed Central","title":"An expanded toolkit for gene tagging based on MiMIC and scarless CRISPR tagging in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095692/","volume":"7"},

Two negatively charged amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of cI play a key role in activation, suggesting that these residues contact RNA polymerase. The subunit of RNA polymerase involved was identified by selecting polymerase mutants that restored the activation function of a mutant form of cI protein. Although previous studies suggest that several activators interact with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, the results here suggest that cI interacts with the sigma subunit. An arginine to histidine change near the carboxyl terminus of sigma specifically suppresses an aspartic acid to asparagine change in the activation region of cI. This finding supports the direct-contact model and suggests that a cluster of positively charged residues near the carboxyl terminus of sigma is the target of the negatively charged activation region of cI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"M."},{"family":"Moyle","given":"H."},{"family":"Susskind","given":"M.

Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12, but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread.

  {"id":"liaw2022","abstract":"Maternally-deposited morphogens specify the fates of embryonic cells via hierarchically regulating the expression of zygotic genes that encode various classes of developmental regulators. Once the cell fates are determined, Polycomb-group proteins frequently maintain the repressed state of the genes. This study investigates how Polycomb-group proteins repress the expression of tailless, which encodes a developmental regulator in Drosophila embryo. Previous studies have shown that maternal Tramtrack69 facilitates maternal GAGA-binding factor and Heat shock factor binding to the torso response element (tor-RE) to initiate tailless repression in the stage-4 embryo. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation and genetic-interaction studies exhibit that maternally-deposited Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) recruited by the tor-RE-associated Tramtrack69 represses tailless expression in the stage-4 embryo. A noncanonical Polycomb-group response element (PRE) is mapped to the tailless proximal region. High levels of Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad (BTB)-domain proteins are fundamental for maintaining tailless repression in the stage-8 to -10 embryos. Trmtrack69 sporadically distributes in the linear BTB-domain oligomer, which recruits and retains a high level of PRC1 near the GCCAT cluster for repressing tll expression in the stage-14 embryos. Disrupting the retention of PRC1 decreases the levels of PRC1 and Pleiohomeotic protein substantially on the PRE and causes tailless derepression in the stage-14 embryo. Furthermore, the retained PRC1 potentially serves as a second foundation for assembling the well-characterized polymer of the Sterile alpha motif domain in Polyhomeotic protein, which compacts chromatin to maintain the repressed state of tailless in the embryos after stage 14.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Liaw","given":"Gwo-Jen"}],"citation-key":"liaw2022","container-title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms","container-title-short":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbagrm.2022.194786","ISSN":"1874-9399","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"194786","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Polycomb repressive complex 1 initiates and maintains tailless repression in Drosophila embryo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939922000013","volume":"1865"},

  {"id":"lin2015","abstract":"A number of approaches for Cas9-mediated transcriptional activation have recently been developed, allowing target genes to be overexpressed from their endogenous genomic loci. However, these approaches have thus far been limited to cell culture, and this technique has not been demonstrated in vivo in any animal. The technique involving the fewest separate components, and therefore the most amenable to in vivo applications, is the dCas9-VPR system, where a nuclease-dead Cas9 is fused to a highly active chimeric activator domain. In this study, we characterize the dCas9-VPR system in Drosophila cells and in vivo. We show that this system can be used in cell culture to upregulate a range of target genes, singly and in multiplex, and that a single guide RNA upstream of the transcription start site can activate high levels of target transcription. We observe marked heterogeneity in guide RNA efficacy for any given gene, and we confirm that transcription is inhibited by guide RNAs binding downstream of the transcription start site. To demonstrate one application of this technique in cells, we used dCas9-VPR to identify target genes for Twist and Snail, two highly conserved transcription factors that cooperate during Drosophila mesoderm development. In addition, we simultaneously activated both Twist and Snail to identify synergistic responses to this physiologically relevant combination. Finally, we show that dCas9-VPR can activate target genes and cause dominant phenotypes in vivo, providing the first demonstration of dCas9 activation in a multicellular animal. Transcriptional activation using dCas9-VPR thus offers a simple and broadly applicable technique for a variety of overexpression studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Shuailiang"},{"family":"Ewen-Campen","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Xiaochun"},{"family":"Housden","given":"Benjamin E"},{"family":"Perrimon","given":"Norbert"}],"citation-key":"lin2015","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.115.181065","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"page":"433-442","source":"Silverchair","title":"In Vivo Transcriptional Activation Using CRISPR/Cas9 in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.115.181065","volume":"201"},

One of the studies shows that Polycomb-repressed domains are more compact than inactive domains and are segregated from neighboring active domains, whereas Hi-C and chromatin accessibility assay as well as the other super-resolution imaging studies paint a different picture. To examine this issue in detail, we analyzed Hi-C libraries of Drosophila chromosomes as well as distance constraints from one of the imaging studies, and modeled different epigenetic domains by employing a polymer-based approach. According to our chromosome models, both Polycomb-repressed and inactive domains are featured with a similar degree of intra-domain packaging and significant intermixing with adjacent active domains.

  {"id":"liu2020a","abstract":"This chapter provides an overview of the technologies we have developed to control proteins with light. First, we focus on the LOV domain, a versatile building block with reversible photo-response, kinetics tunable through mutagenesis, and ready expression in a broad range of cells and animals. Incorporation of LOV into proteins produced a variety of approaches: simple steric block of the active site released when irradiation lengthened a linker (PA-GTPases), reversible release from sequestration at mitochondria (LOVTRAP), and Z-lock, a method in which a light-cleavable bridge is placed where it occludes the active site. The latter two methods make use of Zdk, small engineered proteins that bind selectively to the dark state of LOV. In order to control endogenous proteins, inhibitory peptides are embedded in the LOV domain where they are exposed only upon irradiation (PKA and MLCK inhibition). Similarly, controlled exposure of a nuclear localization sequence and nuclear export sequence is used to reversibly send proteins into the nucleus. Another avenue of engineering makes use of the heterodimerization of FKBP and FRB proteins, induced by the small molecule rapamycin. We control rapamycin with light or simply add it to target cells. Incorporation of fused FKBP-FRB into kinases, guanine exchange factors, or GTPases leads to rapamycininduced protein activation. Kinases are engineered so that they can interact with only a speciﬁc substrate upon activation. Recombination of split proteins using rapamycin-induced conformational changes minimizes spontaneous reassembly. Finally, we explore the insertion of LOV or rapamycin-responsive domains into proteins such that light-induced conformational changes exert allosteric control of the active site. We hope these design ideas will inspire new applications and broaden our reach towards dynamic biological processes that unfold when studied in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Bei"},{"family":"Marston","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Klaus M."}],"citation-key":"liu2020a","container-title":"Photoswitching Proteins","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-0716-0755-8_7","editor":[{"family":"Niopek","given":"Dominik"}],"event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-07-160754-1 978-1-07-160755-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"113-126","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engineering Optogenetic Protein Analogs","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-0716-0755-8_7","volume":"2173"},

  {"id":"lomberk2006","abstract":"Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) was first discovered in Drosophila as a dominant suppressor of position-effect variegation and a major component of heterochromatin. The HP1 family is evolutionarily conserved, with members in fungi, plants and animals but not prokaryotes, and there are multiple members within the same species. The amino-terminal chromodomain binds methylated lysine 9 of histone H3, causing transcriptional repression. The highly conserved carboxy-terminal chromoshadow domain enables dimerization and also serves as a docking site for proteins involved in a wide variety of nuclear functions, from transcription to nuclear architecture. In addition to heterochromatin packaging, it is becoming increasingly clear that HP1 proteins have diverse roles in the nucleus, including the regulation of euchromatic genes. HP1 proteins are amenable to posttranslational modifications that probably regulate these distinct functions, thereby creating a subcode within the context of the 'histone code' of histone posttranslational modifications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Lomberk","given":"Gwen"},{"family":"Wallrath","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Urrutia","given":"Raul"}],"citation-key":"lomberk2006","container-title":"Genome Biology","container-title-short":"Genome Biology","DOI":"10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-228","ISSN":"1474-760X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,7,21]]},"page":"228","source":"BioMed Central","title":"The Heterochromatin Protein 1 family","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-228","volume":"7"},

Genome-wide nucleosome assembly on paternal DNA implies the replacement of sperm chromosomal proteins, such as protamines, by maternally provided histones1,2. This fundamental process is specifically impaired in sésame (ssm), a unique Drosophila maternal effect mutant that prevents male pronucleus formation3. Here we show that ssm is a point mutation in the Hira gene, thus demonstrating that the histone chaperone protein HIRA is required for nucleosome assembly during sperm nucleus decondensation. In vertebrates, HIRA has recently been shown to be critical for a nucleosome assembly pathway independent of DNA synthesis that specifically involves the H3.3 histone variant4,5. We also show that nucleosomes containing H3.3, and not H3, are specifically assembled in paternal Drosophila chromatin before the first round of DNA replication. The exclusive marking of paternal chromosomes with H3.3 represents a primary epigenetic distinction between parental genomes in the zygote, and underlines an important consequence of the critical and highly specialized function of HIRA at fertilization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Loppin","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Bonnefoy","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Anselme","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Laurençon","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Karr","given":"Timothy L."},{"family":"Couble","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"loppin2005","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature04059","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7063","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2005 Nature Publishing Group","number":"7063","page":"1386-1390","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA is essential for chromatin assembly in the male pronucleus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04059","volume":"437"},

BAP1 mutations are also observed at low frequency in other malignancies including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and bladder cancers. BAP1 germline mutations are associated with high incidence of mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and other cancers, defining the \"BAP1 cancer syndrome.\" Interestingly, germline BAP1 mutations constitute an important paradigm for gene-environment interactions, as loss of BAP1 predisposes to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. Inactivating mutations of BAP1 are also identified in sporadic cancers, denoting the importance of this gene for normal tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression, although some oncogenic properties have also been attributed to BAP1. BAP1 belongs to the deubiquitinase superfamily of enzymes, which are responsible for the maturation and turnover of ubiquitin as well as the reversal of substrate ubiquitination, thus regulating ubiquitin signaling. BAP1 is predominantly nuclear and interacts with several chromatin-associated factors, assembling multi-protein complexes with mutually exclusive partners. BAP1 exerts its function through highly regulated deubiquitination of its substrates. As such, BAP1 orchestrates chromatin-associated processes including gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair. BAP1 also exerts cytoplasmic functions, notably in regulating Ca2+ signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum. This DUB is also subjected to multiple post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation and ubiquitination, indicating that several signaling pathways tightly regulate its function. Recent progress indicated that BAP1 plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell metabolism, as well as cell survival and death. In this review, we summarize the biological and molecular functions of BAP1 and explain how the inactivation of this DUB might cause human cancers. We also highlight some of the unresolved questions and suggest potential new directions.","author":[{"literal":"Louis Masclef"},{"literal":"Oumaima Ahmed"},{"literal":"Benjamin Estavoyer"},{"literal":"Bruno Larrivée"},{"literal":"Nathalie Labrecque"},{"literal":"Anastasia Nijnik"},{"literal":"El Bachir Affar"}],"citation-key":"louismasclef2021","container-title":"Cell Death & Differentiation","container-title-short":"Cell Death & Differentiation","DOI":"10.1038/s41418-020-00709-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"title":"Roles and mechanisms of BAP1 deubiquitinase in tumor suppression.","type":"article-journal"},

Our data describe landscapes of long-lived proteins in somatic and reproductive tissues of Drosophila during adult lifespan, and reveal a preferential ubiquitylation of older long-lived proteins. We identify an age-modulated increase of ubiquitylation on long-lived histone 2A protein in Drosophila, which is evolutionarily conserved in mouse, monkey, and human. A reduction of ubiquitylated histone 2A in mutant flies is associated with longevity and healthy lifespan.

PcG proteins were first identified in Drosophila, which still remains the most convenient system for studying PcG-dependent repression. In the Drosophila genome, these proteins bind to DNA regions called Polycomb response elements (PREs). A major role in the recruitment of PcG proteins to PREs is played by DNA-binding factors, several of which have been characterized in detail.

  {"id":"m.wassef2017","abstract":"How a single cell gives rise to multiple cell lineages is a central question in biology. The processes that govern specification of cell identity occur mostly in the absence of modifications of DNA sequence and are thus termed “epigenetic.” Once established, defined cellular states have to be perpetuated from mother to daughter cell. Pioneering studies in prokaryotes and then in eukaryotes led to the identification of regulatory proteins termed transcription factors whose function is to modulate gene expression through direct binding of specific DNA sequences. Subsequent work identified a distinct class of regulatory proteins that act at the level of chromatin through covalent modification of histones, chromatin compaction, or nucleosome remodeling. Two such groups of chromatin modifiers, termed Trithorax and Polycomb, are essential for maintaining active (Trithorax) and repressed (Polycomb) expression states of a number of developmental regulators. Importantly, these functions are conserved in multicellular organisms, from metazoans to plants. In this chapter, we will explore the functions of Polycomb and Trithorax proteins during development. We will first emphasize evidence supporting their specific function in regulating maintenance of cellular identity in diverse organisms. We will then examine the molecular mechanisms through which Polycomb and Trithorax proteins function to fine-tune developmental programs.","author":[{"literal":"M. Wassef"},{"literal":"R.

  {"id":"ma2019a","abstract":"During terminal differentiation, most cells exit the cell cycle and enter into a prolonged or permanent G0 in which they are refractory to mitogenic signals. Entry into G0 is usually initiated through the repression of cell cycle gene expression by formation of a transcriptional repressor complex called dimerization partner (DP), retinoblastoma (RB)-like, E2F and MuvB (DREAM). However, when DREAM repressive function is compromised during terminal differentiation, additional unknown mechanisms act to stably repress cycling and ensure robust cell cycle exit. Here, we provide evidence that developmentally programmed, temporal changes in chromatin accessibility at a small subset of critical cell cycle genes act to enforce cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation in the Drosophila melanogaster wing. We show that during terminal differentiation, chromatin closes at a set of pupal wing enhancers for the key rate-limiting cell cycle regulators Cyclin E (cycE), E2F transcription factor 1 (e2f1), and string (stg). This closing coincides with wing cells entering a robust postmitotic state that is strongly refractory to cell cycle reactivation, and the regions that close contain known binding sites for effectors of mitogenic signaling pathways such as Yorkie and Notch. When cell cycle exit is genetically disrupted, chromatin accessibility at cell cycle genes remains unaffected, and the closing of distal enhancers at cycE, e2f1, and stg proceeds independent of the cell cycling status. Instead, disruption of cell cycle exit leads to changes in accessibility and expression of a subset of hormone-induced transcription factors involved in the progression of terminal differentiation. Our results uncover a mechanism that acts as a cell cycle–independent timer to limit the response to mitogenic signaling and aberrant cycling in terminally differentiating tissues. In addition, we provide a new molecular description of the cross talk between cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation during metamorphosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Yiqin"},{"family":"McKay","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Buttitta","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"ma2019a","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10/ghbnkk","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e3000378","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Changes in chromatin accessibility ensure robust cell cycle exit in terminally differentiated cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000378","volume":"17"},

In plants, it is largely unclear how PcG proteins are recruited to their target genes. Here, we identified the PWWP-DOMAIN INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS1 (PWO1) protein which interacts with all three Arabidopsis PRC2 histone methyltransferases and is required for keeping full H3 occupancy at several Arabidopsis genes. PWO1 localizes and recruits CLF to nuclear speckles in tobacco nuclei, suggesting a role in spatial organization of PcG regulation. PWO1 belongs to a gene family with three members acting redundantly: pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutants are seedling lethal and show shoot and root meristem arrest, while pwo1 single mutants are early flowering. Interestingly, PWWP domain of PWO1 confers binding to histones, which is reduced by a point mutation in a highly conserved residue of this domain and blocked by phosphorylation of H3S28. PWO1 carrying this mutation is not able to fully complement the pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutant, indicating the requirement of this domain for PWO1 in vivo activity. Thus, the PWO family may present a novel class of histone readers which are involved in recruiting PcG proteins to subnuclear domains and in promoting Arabidopsis development.","author":[{"literal":"Mareike L.

  {"id":"martin2009","abstract":"We report here experiments aimed at understanding the connections between cell competition and growth in the Drosophila wing disc. The principal assay has been to generate discs containing marked cells that proliferate at different rates and to study their interactions and their contribution to the final structure. It is known that single clones of fast-dividing cells within a compartment may occupy the larger part of the compartment without affecting its size. This has suggested the existence of interactions involving cell competition between fast- and slow-dividing cells directed to accommodate the contribution of each cell to the final compartment. Here we show that indeed fast-dividing cells can outcompete slow-dividing ones in their proximity. However, we argue that this elimination is of little consequence because preventing apoptosis, and therefore cell competition, in those compartments does not affect the size of the clones or the size of the compartments. Our experiments indicate that cells within a compartment proliferate autonomously at their own rate. The contribution of each cell to the compartment is exclusively determined by its division rate within the frame of a size control mechanism that stops growth once the compartment has reached the final arresting size. This is supported by a computer simulation of the contribution of individual fast clones growing within a population of slower dividing cells and without interacting with them. The values predicted by the simulation are very close to those obtained experimentally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Martín","given":"Francisco A."},{"family":"Herrera","given":"Salvador C."},{"family":"Morata","given":"Ginés"}],"citation-key":"martin2009","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.038406","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,15]]},"page":"3747-3756","source":"Silverchair","title":"Cell competition, growth and size control in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.038406","volume":"136"},
  {"id":"maryleatham-jensen2019","abstract":"Proper determination of cell fates depends on epigenetic information that is used to preserve memory of decisions made earlier in development. Post-translational modification of histone residues is thought to be a central means by which epigenetic information is propagated. In particular, modifications of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are strongly correlated with both gene activation and gene repression. H3K27 acetylation is found at sites of active transcription, whereas H3K27 methylation is found at loci silenced by Polycomb group proteins. The histones bearing these modifications are encoded by the replication-dependent H3 genes as well as the replication-independent H3.3 genes. Owing to differential rates of nucleosome turnover, H3K27 acetylation is enriched on replication-independent H3.3 histones at active gene loci, and H3K27 methylation is enriched on replication-dependent H3 histones across silenced gene loci. Previously, we found that modification of replication-dependent H3K27 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing, but it is not required for gene activation. However, the contribution of replication-independent H3.3K27 to these functions is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the endogenous replication-independent H3.3K27 to a non-modifiable residue. Surprisingly, we find that H3.3K27 is also required for Polycomb target gene silencing despite the association of H3.3 with active transcription. However, the requirement for H3.3K27 comes at a later stage of development than that found for replication-dependent H3K27, suggesting a greater reliance on replication-independent H3.3K27 in post-mitotic cells. Notably, we find no evidence of global transcriptional defects in H3.3K27 mutants, despite the strong correlation between H3.3K27 acetylation and active transcription.","author":[{"literal":"Mary Leatham-Jensen"},{"literal":"Christopher M.

Here, we found that wge induces various histone modiﬁcations and enhances the methylation of Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a feature of heterochromatin. A histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9, is required for wge-mediated H3K9 methylation and eye-towing TD. Su(var)3-9 is also required for classical wound-induced TD but not for normal development, suggesting its involvement in several types of imaginal disc TDs.

  {"id":"maves1998","abstract":"We are investigating how Drosophila imaginal disc cells establish and maintain their appendage-specific determined states. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of wingless (wg) induces leg disc cells to activate expression of the wing marker Vestigial (Vg) and transdetermine to wing cells. Here we show that ectopic wg expression non-cell-autonomously induces Vg expression in leg discs and that activated Armadillo, a cytosolic transducer of the Wg signal, cell-autonomously induces Vg expression in leg discs, indicating that this Vg expression is directly activated by Wg signaling. We find that ubiquitous expression of wg in leg discs can induce only dorsal leg disc cells to express Vg and transdetermine to wing. Dorsal leg disc cells normally express high levels of decapentaplegic (dpp) and its downstream target, optomotor-blind (omb). We find that high levels of dpp expression, which are both necessary and sufficient for dorsal leg development, are required for wg-induced transdetermination. We show that dorsalization of ventral leg disc cells, through targeted expression of either dpp or omb, is sufficient to allow wg to induce Vg expression and wing fate. Thus, dpp and omb promote both dorsal leg cell fate as well as transdetermination-competent leg disc cells. Taken together, our results show that the Wg and Dpp signaling pathways cooperate to induce Vg expression and leg-towing transdetermination. We also show that a specific vg regulatory element, the vg boundary enhancer, is required for transdetermination. We propose that an interaction between Wg and Dpp signaling can explain why leg disc cells transdetermine to wing and that our results have implications for normal leg and wing development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Maves","given":"L."},{"family":"Schubiger","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"maves1998","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.125.1.115","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,1,1]]},"page":"115-124","source":"Silverchair","title":"A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs: interactions between wingless and decapentaplegic signaling","title-short":"A molecular basis for transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.125.1.115","volume":"125"},

We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such “genetically coupled” link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths.

Regeneration in the disc is mediated by a localized region of cell division, known as the regeneration blastema. Most regenerating disc cells strictly adhere to their disc-specific identity; some cells however, switch fate in a phenomenon known as transdetermination. Similar regeneration and transdetermination events can be induced in situ by misexpression of the signaling molecule wingless. Recent studies indicate that the plasticity of disc cells during regeneration is associated with high morphogen activity and the reorganization of chromatin structure.

Temporal profiling of H2AK119ub1 dynamics revealed that atypically broad H2AK119ub1 domains are established, along with H3K27me3, during oocyte growth. From the two-cell stage, H2AK119ub1 is progressively deposited at typical Polycomb targets and precedes H3K27me3. Reduction of H2AK119ub1 by depletion of Polycomb group ring finger 1 (PCGF1) and PCGF6—essential components of variant PRC1 (vPRC1)—leads to H3K27me3 loss at a subset of genes in oocytes. The gene-selective H3K27me3 deficiency is irreversibly inherited by embryos, causing loss of maternal H3K27me3-dependent imprinting, embryonic sublethality and placental enlargement at term. Collectively, our study unveils preceding dynamics of H2AK119ub1 over H3K27me3 at the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and identifies PCGF1/6–vPRC1 as an essential player in maternal epigenetic inheritance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Mei","given":"Hailiang"},{"family":"Kozuka","given":"Chisayo"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Ryoya"},{"family":"Kumon","given":"Mami"},{"family":"Koseki","given":"Haruhiko"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Azusa"}],"citation-key":"mei2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00820-3","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Embryology;Epigenetics\nSubject_term_id: embryology;epigenetics","number":"4","page":"539-550","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"H2AK119ub1 guides maternal inheritance and zygotic deposition of H3K27me3 in mouse embryos","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00820-3","volume":"53"},

The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate nucleosomes to maintain repression of key developmental genes, including  Hox  genes whose temporal and spatial expression is tightly regulated to guide patterning of the anterior-posterior body axis. CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a compaction region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional compaction region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations. We propose that CBX2-driven nucleosome compaction is a key mechanism by which PcG proteins maintain gene silencing during mouse development.","author":[{"literal":"Mei Sheng Lau"},{"literal":"Matthew G.

  {"id":"meyer2009","abstract":"Since their discovery as a substrate for ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the role of thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) has been largely extended through their regulatory function. Both proteins act by changing the structure and activity of a broad spectrum of target proteins, typically by modifying redox status. Trx and Grx are members of families with multiple and partially redundant genes. The number of genes clearly increased with the appearance of multicellular organisms, in part because of new types of Trx and Grx with orthologs throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. The function of Trx and Grx also broadened as cells achieved increased complexity, especially in the regulation arena. In view of these progressive changes, the ubiquitous distribution of Trx and the wide occurrence of Grx enable these proteins to serve as indicators of the evolutionary history of redox regulation. In so doing, they add a unifying element that links the diverse forms of life to one another in an uninterrupted continuum. It is anticipated that future research will embellish this continuum and further elucidate the properties of these proteins and their impact on biology.

  {"id":"michellepherson2017","abstract":"This study examines the role of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) at active genes. The PRC1 and PRC2 complexes are crucial for epigenetic silencing during development of an organism. They are recruited to Polycomb response elements (PREs) and establish silenced domains over several kilobases. Recent studies show that PRC1 is also directly recruited to active genes by the cohesin complex. Cohesin participates broadly in control of gene transcription, but it is unknown whether cohesin-recruited PRC1 also plays a role in transcriptional control of active genes. We address this question using genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The results show that PRC1 influences transcription of active genes, and a significant fraction of its effects are likely direct. The roles of different PRC1 subunits can also vary depending on the gene. Depletion of PRC1 subunits by RNA interference alters phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and occupancy by the Spt5 pausing-elongation factor at most active genes. These effects on Pol II phosphorylation and Spt5 are likely linked to changes in elongation and RNA processing detected by nascent RNA-seq, although the mechanisms remain unresolved. The experiments also reveal that PRC1 facilitates association of Spt5 with enhancers and PREs. Reduced Spt5 levels at these regulatory sequences upon PRC1 depletion coincide with changes in Pol II occupancy and phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that, in addition to its repressive roles in epigenetic gene silencing, PRC1 broadly influences transcription of active genes and may suppress transcription of nonpromoter regulatory sequences.","author":[{"literal":"Michelle Pherson"},{"literal":"Ziva Misulovin"},{"literal":"Maria Gause"},{"literal":"Kathie Mihindukulasuriya"},{"literal":"Amanda Swain"},{"literal":"Dale Dorsett"}],"citation-key":"michellepherson2017","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1700944","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title":"Polycomb repressive complex 1 modifies transcription of active genes","type":"article-journal"},

A broad variety of alterations can impair PRC2 activity; yet, overall, only one type of alteration is found in a given class of tumor. We discuss the potential impact of the various types of PRC2 alterations on gene expression. We propose that the distinct set of genes regulated by PRC2, depending on tumor etiology, constrain the type of alteration of PRC2 that can fuel tumor development.

PcG proteins assemble into two major types of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) endowed with distinct histone-tail-modifying activities.

Now, with the availability of vast amounts of data across various biological systems, the functional role of PTMs in important processes (such as transcription, recombination, replication, DNA repair and the modulation of genomic architecture) is slowly emerging.

The critical event that permits embryonic cells to develop into the appendage primordia is expression of a homeobox gene called Distal-less ( Dll). All imaginal discs subdivide into anterior and posterior compartments. The wing also subdivides into dorsal and ventral compartments in later stages in development. Cells at compartment borders produce morphogens — secreted signalling molecules such as hedgehog (Hh), wingless (Wg) and decapentaplegic (Dpp) — that pattern appendages by forming gradients. Cells respond to these morphogens by activating different patterns of gene expression, depending on the level of morphogen. Trunk cells become separated from appendage cells by mutual antagonism between Hh/Wg/Dpp at the centre of the disc, and the homeobox genes homothorax (hth) and extradenticle ( exd), at the periphery. The response to the gradient of Wg and Dpp signals generates distinct genetic domains along the proximodistal axis of the appendage: high Wg and Dpp levels in the centre of the disc (which becomes the distal appendage) activate Dll, whereas moderate levels in the intermediate zone (which becomes the more proximal appendage) activate  dachshund (dac). Appendage identity is specified by a combination of homeobox gene expression, which specifies the segment, and Dpp or Wg response genes, which specify dorsal or ventral properties. The mechanisms used in Drosophila to segregate the cells fated to form appendages and the genes involved are conserved in vertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Morata","given":"Ginés"}],"citation-key":"morata2001","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/35052047","ISSN":"1471-0080","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2001 Nature Publishing Group","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews","number":"2","page":"89-97","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"How drosophila appendages develop","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/35052047","volume":"2"},

These contain various lineage blocks, compartments, which express distinct genetic programmes. It has been found that after massive damage to a compartment cells from a neighbour compartment can transgress the compartment border and contribute to its regeneration. The transgressing cells are genetically reprogrammed and acquire a new identity, a process facilitated by up regulation of the JNK pathway and transient loss of epigenetic control by the Pc-G and trx-G genes. The final acquisition of the new identity appears to be mediated by induction by neighbour cells, a phenomenon akin the Community Effect described for the specification of amphibian muscle cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Morata","given":"Ginés"},{"family":"Herrera","given":"Salvador C"}],"citation-key":"morata2016","collection-title":"Cell reprogramming, regeneration and repair","container-title":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.gde.2016.05.008","ISSN":"0959-437X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"11-16","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Cell reprogramming during regeneration in Drosophila: transgression of compartment boundaries","title-short":"Cell reprogramming during regeneration in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X16300478","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"mouri2012","abstract":"Planar cell polarity (PCP) refers to the coordination of global organ axes and individual cell polarity in vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia. Mechanisms of PCP have been best studied in the Drosophila wing, in which each epidermal cell produces a single wing hair at the distal cell edge, and this spatial specification is mediated by redistribution of the core group proteins, including the seven-pass transmembrane cadherin Flamingo/Starry night (Fmi/Stan), to selective plasma membrane domains. Through genetic screening, we found that a mutation of the SMC3 gene caused dramatic misspecification of wing hair positions. SMC3 protein is one subunit of the cohesin complex, which regulates sister chromatid cohesion and also plays a role in transcriptional control of gene expression. In the SMC3 mutant cells, Fmi appeared to be upregulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism(s), and this elevation of Fmi was at least one cause of the PCP defect. In addition to the PCP phenotype, the loss of the cohesin function affected wing morphogenesis at multiple levels: one malformation was loss of the wing margin, and this was most likely a result of downregulation of the homeodomain protein Cut. At the cellular level, apical cell size and hexagonal packing were affected in the mutant wing. Dysfunction of cohesin in humans results in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which is characterized by various developmental abnormalities and mental retardation. Our analysis of cohesin in epithelia may provide new insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms of CdLS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Mouri","given":"Kousuke"},{"family":"Horiuchi","given":"Shin-ya"},{"family":"Uemura","given":"Tadashi"}],"citation-key":"mouri2012","container-title":"Genes to Cells","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2443.2012.01604.x","ISSN":"1365-2443","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"509-524","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Cohesin controls planar cell polarity by regulating the level of the seven-pass transmembrane cadherin Flamingo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2443.2012.01604.x","volume":"17"},

The Polycomb Repressive Complexes PRC1 and PRC2 catalyse distinct chromatin modifications to enforce gene silencing, but how transcriptional repression is propagated through mitotic cell divisions remains a key unresolved question. Using reversible tethering of PcG proteins to ectopic sites in mouse embryonic stem cells, here we show that PRC1 can trigger transcriptional repression and Polycomb-dependent chromatin modifications. We find that canonical PRC1 (cPRC1), but not variant PRC1, maintains gene silencing through cell division upon reversal of tethering. Propagation of gene repression is sustained by cis-acting histone modifications, PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 and cPRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1, promoting a sequence-independent feedback mechanism for PcG protein recruitment. Thus, the distinct PRC1 complexes present in vertebrates can differentially regulate epigenetic maintenance of gene silencing, potentially enabling dynamic heritable responses to complex stimuli.

We screened for lncRNAs, which co-precipitate with PRC1 from chromatin and found candidates that impact polycomb group protein (PcG)-regulated gene expression in vivo. A novel lncRNA from this screen, CAT7, regulates expression and polycomb group binding at the MNX1 locus during early neuronal differentiation. CAT7 contains a unique tandem repeat domain that shares high sequence similarity to a non-syntenic zebrafish analog, cat7l. Defects caused by interference of cat7l RNA during zebrafish embryogenesis were rescued by human CAT7 RNA, enhanced by interference of a PRC1 component, and suppressed by interference of a known PRC1 target gene, demonstrating cat7l genetically interacts with a PRC1. We propose a model whereby PRC1 acts in concert with specific lncRNAs and that CAT7/cat7l represents convergent lncRNAs that independently evolved to tune PRC1 repression at individual loci.","author":[{"literal":"Mridula Kumari Ray"},{"literal":"Ole Wiskow"},{"literal":"Matthew J.

  {"id":"muller2006","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are conserved regulatory proteins that repress transcription of particular target genes in animals and plants. Studies over the past decade have established that most PcG proteins are not classic DNA binding factors but that they exist in multisubunit protein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin. Nevertheless, PcG repression of target genes in Drosophila requires specific cis-regulatory sequences, called Polycomb response elements (PREs), and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that, in vivo, most PcG proteins are specifically bound at the PREs of target genes. However, the mechanisms by which these PcG protein complexes are recruited to PREs and how they repress transcription are still poorly understood. Recent studies challenge earlier models that invoke covalent histone modifications and chromatin binding as the key steps in the recruitment of PcG proteins to PREs. The available evidence suggests that PREs are largely devoid of nucleosomes and that PRE DNA serves as an assembly platform for many different PcG protein complexes through DNA–protein and protein–protein interactions. The emerging picture suggests that the binding and modification of chromatin by PcG proteins is needed for interaction of PRE-tethered PcG protein complexes with nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin in order to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state at promoters and coding regions of target genes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"},{"family":"Kassis","given":"Judith A"}],"citation-key":"muller2006","collection-title":"Differentiation and gene regulation","container-title":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.gde.2006.08.005","ISSN":"0959-437X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"476-484","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Polycomb response elements and targeting of Polycomb group proteins in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X06001560","volume":"16"},

It is commonly proposed that PcG dependent changes in genome folding, which compact chromatin, contribute directly to repression by blocking binding of activating complexes and demixing repressed targets from non-repressed chromatin. To test this model we utilized Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) to trace the 3-dimensional folding of the Hoxa gene cluster, a canonical Polycomb target, allowing us to analyze thousands of DNA traces in single cells. In cell types ranging from embryonic stem cells to brain tissue, we find that PcG-bound chromatin frequently explores decompact states and partial mixing with neighboring chromatin, while remaining uniformly repressed, challenging the repression-by-compaction model. Using polymer physics simulations, we show that the flexible ensembles we observe can be explained by dynamic contacts mediated by multivalent interactions that are too weak to induce phase separation. Instead, these transient contacts contribute to accurate propagation of the epigenetic state without ectopic spreading or gradual erosion.

During this culture T. thermophila cells harboring Chlorella cells emerged by phagocytotic uptake, and increased in frequency, reaching ca. 80–90%. This level was maintained in the late stage of ecosystem dynamics. Analysis of the ecosystem dynamics in the microcosm revealed that a complex causal process through direct/indirect interactions among ecosystem components led to reduction in dissolved O2 and food (E. coli) available to the T. thermophila, which gave a selective advantage to the organisms in the endosymbiotic association. This result suggests that the endosymbiosis evolves in a mature stage of ecosystem development, where reproduction and survival of prospective partner organisms is highly resource-limited and density-dependent, favoring efﬁcient matter/energy transfers among participating organisms due to physical proximity.

However, how these systems function to achieve transcriptional regulation remains very poorly understood. Here, we discover that the histone H2AK119 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is defined by the composition of its catalytic subunits and is highly regulated by RYBP/YAF2-dependent stimulation. In mouse embryonic stem cells, RYBP plays a central role in shaping H2AK119 mono-ubiquitylation at PcG targets and underpins an activity-based communication between PRC1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is required for normal histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Without normal histone modification-dependent communication between PRC1 and PRC2, repressive Polycomb chromatin domains can erode, rendering target genes susceptible to inappropriate gene expression signals. This suggests that activity-based communication and histone modification-dependent thresholds create a localized form of epigenetic memory required for normal PcG chromatin domain function in gene regulation.","author":[{"literal":"Nathan R.

We also analyzed the distribution of GAGA factor (GAF), a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is found at most previously identified PREs. Our data show that PC and PH often bind to clustered regions within large loci that encode transcription factors which play multiple roles in developmental patterning and in the regulation of cell proliferation. GAF co-localizes with PC and PH to a limited extent, suggesting that GAF is not a necessary component of chromatin at PREs.

To determine whether pioneer-factor function is intrinsic to the protein or whether pioneering activity is developmentally modulated, we studied the highly conserved, essential transcription factor Grainy head (Grh). Prior work established that Grh is expressed throughout Drosophila development and is a pioneer factor in the larva. We demonstrated that Grh remains bound to mitotic chromosomes, a property shared with other pioneer factors. By assaying chromatin accessibility in embryos lacking maternal and/or zygotic Grh at three stages of development, we discovered that Grh is not required for chromatin accessibility in early embryogenesis, in contrast to its essential functions later in development.

  {"id":"nicolafestuccia2017","abstract":"The propagation and maintenance of gene expression programs are at the foundation of the preservation of cell identity. A large and complex set of epigenetic mechanisms enables the long-term stability and inheritance of transcription states. A key property of authentic epigenetic regulation is being independent from the instructive signals used for its establishment. This makes epigenetic regulation, particularly epigenetic silencing, extremely robust and powerful to lock regulatory states and stabilise cell identity. In line with this, the establishment of epigenetic silencing during development restricts cell potency and maintains the cell fate choices made by transcription factors (TFs). However, how more immature cells that have not yet established their definitive fate maintain their transitory identity without compromising their responsiveness to signalling cues remains unclear. A paradigmatic example is provided by pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from a transient population of cells of the blastocyst. Here, we argue that ES cells represent an interesting “epigenetic paradox”: even though they are captured in a self-renewing state characterised by extremely efficient maintenance of their identity, which is a typical manifestation of robust epigenetic regulation, they seem not to heavily rely on classical epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, self-renewal strictly depends on the TFs that previously instructed their undifferentiated identity and relies on a particular signalling-dependent chromatin state where repressive chromatin marks play minor roles. Although this “epigenetic paradox” may underlie their exquisite responsiveness to developmental cues, it suggests that alternative mechanisms to faithfully propagate gene regulatory states might be prevalent in ES cells.","author":[{"literal":"Nicola Festuccia"},{"literal":"Inma Gonzalez"},{"literal":"Pablo Navarro"}],"citation-key":"nicolafestuccia2017","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2016.12.009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title":"The Epigenetic Paradox of Pluripotent ES Cells.","type":"article-journal"},

We propose two hypotheses through which tissue patterning could be coordinated with whole-body development to generate this robustness. Our first hypothesis states that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time. The second hypothesis is that tissue patterning aligns at developmental milestones. To distinguish between our two hypotheses, we developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using the expression of canonical patterning genes, linking our scheme to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering and pupariation. We used our scheme to explore how the progression of pattern changes when developmental time is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis that drives developmental progression. We found the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. Between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Furthermore, our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage. Thus for wing disc patterning, wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone. Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones.

Some of the trxG proteins characterized so far are members of chromatin opening complexes (e.g. SWI/SNF and GAGA/NURF) which facilitate binding of transcription factors and components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Genetic and biochemical data suggest that these two groups of regulatory factors may act through a common set of DNA elements. In the present study, we have investigated the binding of Trithorax (TRX) and Polycomb (PC) protein in the bithorax complex (BX-C) during embryogenesis. In addition, we have identified the minimal fragments from the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) regulatory region that are capable of recruiting TRX to chromosomal sites containing them. Comparative analysis of the binding of the two proteins shows that TRX and PC bind target sequences (PcG-regulated elements, PREs) by cellular blastoderm, when BX-C transcription begins. At the same stage, TRX but not PC is strongly associated with core promoters. Later, at germ band extension, the time of derepression in Polycomb mutants, PC binding is also detected outside core PREs and additionally binds to the fragments containing promoters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Orlando","given":"V"},{"family":"Jane","given":"E P"},{"family":"Chinwalla","given":"V"},{"family":"Harte","given":"P J"},{"family":"Paro","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"orlando1998","container-title":"The EMBO Journal","container-title-short":"EMBO J","DOI":"10.1093/emboj/17.17.5141","ISSN":"0261-4189","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,9,1]]},"page":"5141-5150","PMCID":"PMC1170842","PMID":"9724650","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Binding of trithorax and Polycomb proteins to the bithorax complex: dynamic changes during early Drosophila embryogenesis.","title-short":"Binding of trithorax and Polycomb proteins to the bithorax complex","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170842/","volume":"17"},

Binding of multiple sequence-specific factors at discrete Polycomb response elements (PREs) is thought to recruit repressive complexes that spread across an extended chromatin domain. To dissect the structure of PREs, we applied high-resolution mapping of nonhistone chromatin proteins in native chromatin of Drosophila cells. Analysis of occupied sites reveal interactions between transcription factors that stabilize Polycomb anchoring to DNA, and implicate the general transcription factor ADF1 as a novel PRE component. By comparing two Drosophila cell lines with differential chromatin states, we provide evidence that repression is accomplished by enhanced Polycomb recruitment both to PREs and to target promoters of repressed genes.

Targeting PRCs to the correct sites in chromatin is essential for their function. However, the mechanisms by which PRCs are recruited to their target genes in mammals are multifactorial and complex. Here we review DNA binding by polycomb group proteins. There is strong evidence that the DNA-binding subunits of PRCs and their DNA-binding activities are required for chromatin binding and CpG targeting in cells. In vitro, CpG-specific binding was observed for truncated proteins externally to the context of their PRCs. Yet, the mere DNA sequence cannot fully explain the subset of CpG islands that are targeted by PRCs in any given cell type. At this time we find very little structural and biophysical evidence to support a model where sequence-specific DNA-binding activity is required or sufficient for the targeting of CpG-dinucleotide sequences by polycomb group proteins while they are within the context of their respective PRCs, either PRC1 or PRC2. We discuss the current knowledge and open questions on how the DNA-binding activities of polycomb group proteins facilitate the targeting of PRCs to chromatin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"Brady M"},{"family":"Davidovich","given":"Chen"}],"citation-key":"owen2022","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","container-title-short":"Nucleic Acids Res","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkac290","ISSN":"0305-1048","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,30]]},"page":"4813-4839","PMCID":"PMC9122586","PMID":"35489059","source":"PubMed Central","title":"DNA binding by polycomb-group proteins: searching for the link to CpG islands","title-short":"DNA binding by polycomb-group proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9122586/","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"palozola2019","abstract":"The highly reproducible inheritance of chromosomes during mitosis in mammalian cells involves nuclear envelope breakdown, increased chromatin compaction, loss of long-range intrachromosomal interactions, loss of enhancer–promoter proximity, displacement of many transcription regulators from the chromatin and a marked decrease in RNA synthesis. Despite these dramatic changes in the mother cell, daughter cells are able to faithfully re-establish the parental chromatin and gene expression features characteristic of the cell type. Pioneering studies of mitotic chromatin signatures showed that despite global repression of transcription, the Hsp70 gene promoter retains an open chromatin conformation, which was proposed to allow the reactivation of the Hsp70 gene upon completion of mitosis — a phenomenon termed mitotic bookmarking. It was later shown that various cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) in erythroblasts and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) in hepatocytes, remain bound at a subset of their interphase binding sites in mitosis. Such bookmarking transcription factors remain on chromosomes in mitosis and have been shown to enable a subset of genes to be reactivated in a timely fashion upon mitotic exit. In addition, sensitive new methods to measure transcription revealed that mitotic cells retain residual transcription at a large number of genes. Furthermore, genes recover their interphase level of transcription in distinct waves. Thus, gene expression is precisely regulated as cells pass through mitosis to ensure faithful propagation of cell identity and function through cellular generations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Palozola","given":"Katherine C."},{"family":"Lerner","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Zaret","given":"Kenneth S."}],"citation-key":"palozola2019","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s41580-018-0077-z","ISSN":"1471-0080","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Epigenetic memory;Histone post-translational modifications;Mitosis;Transcription;Transcription factors\nSubject_term_id: epigenetic-memory;histone-post-translational-modifications;mitosis;transcription;transcription-factors","number":"1","page":"55-64","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A changing paradigm of transcriptional memory propagation through mitosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-018-0077-z","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"papp2006","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins act as antagonistic regulators to maintain transcriptional OFF and ON states of HOX and other target genes. To study the molecular basis of PcG/trxG control, we analyzed the chromatin of the HOX gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in UbxOFFand UbxONcells purified from developing Drosophila. We find that PcG protein complexes PhoRC, PRC1, and PRC2 and the Trx protein are all constitutively bound to Polycomb response elements (PREs) in the OFF and ON state. In contrast, the trxG protein Ash1 is only bound in the ON state; not at PREs but downstream of the transcription start site. In the OFF state, we find extensive trimethylation at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20 across the entire Ubx gene; i.e., throughout the upstream control, promoter, and coding region. In the ON state, the upstream control region is also trimethylated at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20, but all three modifications are absent in the promoter and 5′ coding region. Our analyses of mutants that lack the PcG histone methyltransferase (HMTase) E(z) or the trxG HMTase Ash1 provide strong evidence that differential histone lysine trimethylation at the promoter and in the coding region confers transcriptional ON and OFF states of Ubx. In particular, our results suggest that PRE-tethered PcG protein complexes act over long distances to generate Pc-repressed chromatin that is trimethylated at H3-K27, H3-K9, and H4-K20, but that the trxG HMTase Ash1 selectively prevents this trimethylation in the promoter and coding region in the ON state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Papp","given":"Bernadett"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"papp2006","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.388706","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2041-2054","PMID":"16882982","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"Histone trimethylation and the maintenance of transcriptional ON and OFF states by trxG and PcG proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/15/2041","volume":"20"},

Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are members of multiprotein complexes that are highly conserved throughout evolution. Historically, they have been described as essential for maintaining epigenetic cellular memory by locking homeotic genes in a transcriptionally repressed state. What was initially thought to be a function restricted to a few target genes, subsequently turned out to be of much broader relevance, since the main role of PcG complexes is to ensure a dynamically choregraphed spatio-temporal regulation of their numerous target genes during development. Their ability to modify chromatin landscapes and refine the expression of master genes controlling major switches in cellular decisions under physiological conditions is often misregulated in tumors. Surprisingly, their functional implication in the initiation and progression of cancer may be either dependent on Polycomb complexes, or specific for a subunit that acts independently of other PcG members. In this review, we describe how misregulated Polycomb proteins play a pleiotropic role in cancer by altering a broad spectrum of biological processes such as the proliferation-differentiation balance, metabolism and the immune response, all of which are crucial in tumor progression. We also illustrate how interfering with PcG functions can provide a powerful strategy to counter tumor progression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Parreno","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Anne-Marie"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Giacomo"}],"citation-key":"parreno2022","container-title":"Cell Research","container-title-short":"Cell Res","DOI":"10.1038/s41422-021-00606-6","ISSN":"1748-7838","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"3","page":"231-253","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mechanisms of Polycomb group protein function in cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00606-6","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"peterson2004","abstract":"The Drosophila Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) protein is a transcriptional repressor of the Polycomb group (PcG). Although genetic studies establish SCM as a crucial PcG member, its molecular role is not known. To investigate how SCM might link to PcG complexes, we analyzed the in vivo role of a conserved protein interaction module, the SPM domain. This domain is found in SCM and in another PcG protein, Polyhomeotic (PH), which is a core component of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). SCM-PH interactions in vitro are mediated by their respective SPM domains. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays were used to isolate and characterize &gt;30 missense mutations in the SPM domain of SCM. Genetic rescue assays showed that SCM repressor function in vivo is disrupted by mutations that impair SPM domain interactions in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of an isolated, wild-type SPM domain produced PcG loss-of-function phenotypes in flies. Coassembly of SCM with a reconstituted PRC1 core complex shows that SCM can partner with PRC1. However, gel filtration chromatography showed that the bulk of SCM is biochemically separable from PH in embryo nuclear extracts. These results suggest that SCM, although not a core component of PRC1, interacts and functions with PRC1 in gene silencing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Peterson","given":"Aidan J"},{"family":"Mallin","given":"Daniel R"},{"family":"Francis","given":"Nicole J"},{"family":"Ketel","given":"Carrie S"},{"family":"Stamm","given":"Joyce"},{"family":"Voeller","given":"Rochus K"},{"family":"Kingston","given":"Robert E"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Jeffrey A"}],"citation-key":"peterson2004","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.104.027474","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,7,1]]},"page":"1225-1239","source":"Silverchair","title":"Requirement for Sex Comb on Midleg Protein Interactions in Drosophila Polycomb Group Repression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.027474","volume":"167"},

Mutations in the polycombeotic gene also cause defects not reported for mutations in other polycomb-group genes. Females homozygous for the most extreme temperature-sensitive allele are sterile, and larvae homozygous for null alleles have small imaginal discs and reduced frequencies of mitotic figures in the brain. Dominant mutations originally identified as enhancers or suppressors of zeste are gain-of-function alleles of polycombeotic.

  {"id":"phillips2008","abstract":"Epistasis has been used to describe a number of phenomena, including the functional interaction between genes, the genetic outcome of mutations acting within the same genetic pathway, and the statistical deviation from additive gene action. Converging interests across genetics suggests that it is now time to develop a more unified view of epistasis and gene interactions.One of the traditional uses of epistasis analysis has been to order genes within developmental and metabolic pathways. These approaches have recently become much more systematic through the use of high-throughput genetic screens, especially in yeast. These studies show that gene interactions are ubiquitous and can be used to help understand the structure of complex genetic networks.The major limitation of comprehensive analyses of gene interactions is the total number of interactions that must ultimately be tested, which grows at approximately the square of the number of genes (for example, >18 million interactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome). Future work in this area will need to focus on particular subsets of this interaction space using information from other sources, such as functional genomics.Epistasis can be a major barrier to inferring the genetic basis of complex traits within natural populations. The effects of many QTLs might be obscured by interactions with other loci, which can make mapping difficult.Human genetic disease is one area in which epistasis seems to be fairly common, although we have few examples in which the functional basis of a particular interaction has been demonstrated. Epistasis is one possible explanation for why human mapping results can be difficult to replicate.Epistasis arises as a natural by-product of the evolutionary process, as all subsequent evolutionary change is built upon genetic changes that have occurred previously.There is clear evidence that epistasis helps to structure the possible pathways that evolution can follow but, even after nearly a century of debate on the topic, we still do not know if epistasis creates a major barrier to evolutionary change.An increased focus on the quantitative effects of gene interactions will provide the basis for a unified approach to studies of gene interaction, while providing a point of articulation between genetics, functional genomics, evolutionary genetics and systems biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Patrick C."}],"citation-key":"phillips2008","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Genet","DOI":"10.1038/nrg2452","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2008 Nature Publishing Group","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews","number":"11","page":"855-867","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Epistasis — the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2452","volume":"9"},

The Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) family complexes are central to maintaining this repression. These include a set of canonical PRC1 complexes, each of which contains four core proteins, including one from the CBX family. These complexes have been shown previously to reside in membraneless organelles called Polycomb bodies, leading to speculation that canonical PRC1 might be found in a separate phase from the rest of the nucleus. We show here that reconstituted PRC1 readily phase-separates into droplets in vitro at low concentrations and physiological salt conditions. This behavior is driven by the CBX2 subunit. Point mutations in an internal domain of Cbx2 eliminate phase separation. These same point mutations eliminate the formation of puncta in cells and have been shown previously to eliminate nucleosome compaction in vitro and generate axial patterning defects in mice. Thus, the domain of CBX2 that is important for phase separation is the same domain shown previously to be important for chromatin compaction and proper development, raising the possibility of a mechanistic or evolutionary link between these activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Plys","given":"Aaron J."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Christopher P."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jongmin"},{"family":"Rizki","given":"Gizem"},{"family":"Keenen","given":"Madeline M."},{"family":"Marr","given":"Sharon K."},{"family":"Kingston","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"plys2019","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev","DOI":"10.1101/gad.326488.119","ISSN":"0890-9369","issue":"13-14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"page":"799-813","PMCID":"PMC6601514","PMID":"31171700","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Phase separation of Polycomb-repressive complex 1 is governed by a charged disordered region of CBX2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6601514/","volume":"33"},

These properties probably facilitate local H3K27me2/3 spreading, causing heterochromatin formation and gene repression. Here, cryo-EM reconstructions of human PRC2 bound to bifunctional dinucleosomes show how a single PRC2, via interactions with nucleosomal DNA, positions the H3 tails of the activating and substrate nucleosome to interact with the EED subunit and the SET domain of EZH2, respectively.

  {"id":"prudhomme2007","abstract":"Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory evolution: (i) uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; (ii) minimizes the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene expression; and (iii) allows interactions to arise among any transcription factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest morphological differences among closely related species and more profound anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Prud'homme","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Gompel","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Sean B."}],"citation-key":"prudhomme2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0700488104","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"suppl 1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,15]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA","page":"8605-8612","PMID":"17494759","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Colloquium Paper","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Emerging principles of regulatory evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/104/suppl_1/8605","volume":"104"},

To address this challenge, we design single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated with up to 16 MS2 binding motifs to enable robust fluorescent signal amplification. These engineered sgRNAs enable multicolour labelling of low-repeat-containing regions using a single sgRNA and of non-repetitive regions with as few as four unique sgRNAs.

  {"id":"ray2022","abstract":"During development, neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning as they age to sequentially generate differently fated progeny. Temporal patterning of neural progenitors is relatively well-studied in Drosophila. Temporal cascades of transcription factors or opposing temporal gradients of RNA-binding proteins are expressed in neural progenitors as they age to control the fates of the progeny. The temporal progression is mostly driven by intrinsic mechanisms including cross-regulations between temporal genes, but environmental cues also play important roles in certain transitions. Vertebrate neural progenitors demonstrate greater plasticity in response to extrinsic cues. Recent studies suggest that vertebrate neural progenitors are also temporally patterned by a combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in response to extracellular signaling to regulate neural fate specification. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the study of temporal patterning of neural progenitors in Drosophila and vertebrates. We also discuss the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, specifically the Polycomb group complexes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, in the temporal patterning of neural progenitors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ray","given":"Alokananda"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Hailun"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"ray2022","container-title":"Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.10.006","ISSN":"0012-1606","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"116-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of temporal patterning in neural progenitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160621002281","volume":"481"},

Here, we measure chromatin accessibility in isolated neural and mesodermal lineages across a time course of Drosophila embryogenesis. Promoters, including tissue-specific genes, are often constitutively open, even in contexts where the gene is not expressed. In contrast, the majority of distal elements have dynamic, tissue-specific accessibility. Enhancer priming appears rarely within a lineage, perhaps reflecting the speed of Drosophila embryogenesis. However, many tissue-specific enhancers are accessible in other lineages early on and become progressively closed as embryogenesis proceeds. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tissue- and time-resolved resource to definitively identify single-cell clusters, to uncover predictive motifs, and to identify many regulators of tissue development. For one such predicted neural regulator, l(3)neo38, we generate a loss-of-function mutant and uncover an essential role for neuromuscular junction and brain development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Reddington","given":"James P."},{"family":"Garfield","given":"David A."},{"family":"Sigalova","given":"Olga M."},{"family":"Karabacak Calviello","given":"Aslihan"},{"family":"Marco-Ferreres","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Girardot","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Viales","given":"Rebecca R."},{"family":"Degner","given":"Jacob F."},{"family":"Ohler","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Furlong","given":"Eileen E.

However, certain developmentally regulated genes lack histone 3 lysine 9 and 27 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) and histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, histone modifications common to most active genes. Here we describe a chromatin state featuring unique histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) peaks in key tissue-specific genes in Drosophila and human cells. Replacing H3K14 in Drosophila demonstrates that H3K14 is essential for expression of genes devoid of canonical histone modifications in the embryonic gut and larval wing imaginal disc, causing lethality and defective wing patterning. We find that the SWI/SNF protein Brahma (Brm) recognizes H3K14ac, that brm acts in the same genetic pathway as H3K14R, and that chromatin accessibility at H3K14ac-unique genes is decreased in H3K14R mutants. Our results show that acetylation of a single lysine is essential at genes devoid of canonical histone marks and uncover an important requirement for H3K14 in tissue-specific gene regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Regadas","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Dahlberg","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Vaid","given":"Roshan"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Oanh"},{"family":"Belikov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Dixit","given":"Gunjan"},{"family":"Deindl","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Jiayu"},{"family":"Mannervik","given":"Mattias"}],"citation-key":"regadas2021","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2021.01.041","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1766-1780.e10","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A unique histone 3 lysine 14 chromatin signature underlies tissue-specific gene regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276521000617","volume":"81"},

The model accurately recapitulates published studies of PRE/TRE mediated epigenetic memory of both silencing and activation. With minimal parameter changes, the same model can also recapitulate experimental data for a different PRE/TRE that allows dynamic regulation of its target gene. The model predicts that both cell cycle length and PRE/TRE identity are critical for determining whether the system gives stable memory or dynamic regulation.

We demonstrate that brain tumours in l(3)mbt mutants originate from overproliferation of neuroepithelial cells in the optic lobes caused by derepression of target genes in the Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway. We use ChIP-sequencing to identify L(3)mbt binding sites and show that L(3)mbt binds to chromatin insulator elements. Mutating l(3)mbt or inhibiting expression of the insulator protein gene mod(mdg4) results in upregulation of SWH pathway reporters. As l(3)mbt tumours are rescued by mutations in bantam or yorkie or by overexpression of Expanded, the deregulation of SWH pathway target genes is an essential step in brain tumour formation. Therefore, very different primary defects result in the formation of brain tumours, which behave quite similarly in their advanced stages. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  {"id":"rickels2016","abstract":"Polycomb response elements (PREs) are specific DNA sequences that stably maintain the developmental pattern of gene expression. Drosophila PREs are well characterized, whereas the existence of PREs in mammals remains debated. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which CpG islands recruit Polycomb group (PcG) complexes; however, which subset of CGIs is selected to serve as PREs is unclear. Trithorax (Trx) positively regulates gene expression in Drosophila and co-occupies PREs to antagonize Polycomb-dependent silencing. Here we demonstrate that Trx-dependent H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) marks Drosophila PREs and maintains the developmental expression pattern of nearby genes. Similarly, the mammalian Trx homolog, MLL1, deposits H3K4me2 at CpG-dense regions that could serve as PREs. In the absence of MLL1 and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 levels, a mark of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), increase at these loci. By inhibiting PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 in the absence of MLL1, we can rescue expression of these loci, demonstrating a functional balance between MLL1 and PRC2 activities at these sites. Thus, our study provides rules for identifying cell-type-specific functional mammalian PREs within the human genome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rickels","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Deqing"},{"family":"Collings","given":"Clayton K."},{"family":"Woodfin","given":"Ashley R."},{"family":"Piunti","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Man"},{"family":"Herz","given":"Hans-Martin"},{"family":"Kvon","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Shilatifard","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"rickels2016","container-title":"Molecular Cell","container-title-short":"Molecular Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.018","ISSN":"1097-2765","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,21]]},"language":"en","page":"318-328","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An Evolutionary Conserved Epigenetic Mark of Polycomb Response Elements Implemented by Trx/MLL/COMPASS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516302763","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"ross1993","abstract":"A DNA sequence rich in (A+T), located upstream of the -10, -35 region of the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA promoter rrnB P1 and called the UP element, stimulates transcription by a factor of 30 in vivo, as well as in vitro in the absence of protein factors other than RNA polymerase (RNAP). When fused to other promoters, such as lacUV5, the UP element also stimulates transcription, indicating that it is a separate promoter module. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit of RNAP prevent stimulation of these promoters by the UP element although the mutant enzymes are effective in transcribing the \"core\" promoters (those lacking the UP element). Protection of UP element DNA by the mutant RNAPs is severely reduced in footprinting experiments, suggesting that the selective decrease in transcription might result from defective interactions between alpha and the UP element. Purified alpha binds specifically to the UP element, confirming that alpha acts directly in promoter recognition. Transcription of three other promoters was also reduced by the COOH-terminal alpha mutations. These results suggest that UP elements comprise a third promoter recognition region (in addition to the -10, -35 recognition hexamers, which interact with the sigma subunit) and may account for the presence of (A+T)-rich DNA upstream of many prokaryotic promoters. Since the same alpha mutations also block activation by some transcription factors, mechanisms of promoter stimulation by upstream DNA elements and positive control by certain transcription factors may be related.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"W."},{"family":"Gosink","given":"K.

During dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo, specific “mixer cells” (MCs) are reprogrammed in a JNK-dependent manner to express the posterior determinant engrailed (en) and cross the segment boundary. Here, we show that JNK signaling induces de novo expression of en in the MCs through repression of Polycomb (Pc) and release of the en locus from the silencing PcG bodies. Whereas reprogramming occurs in MCs from all thoracic and abdominal segments, cell mixing is restricted to the central abdominal region.

  {"id":"ruiz-losada2018","abstract":"Appendages are external projections of the body that serve the animal for locomotion, feeding, or environment exploration. The appendages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are derived from the imaginal discs, epithelial sac-like structures specified in the embryo that grow and pattern during larva development. In the last decades, genetic and developmental studies in the fruit fly have provided extensive knowledge regarding the mechanisms that direct the formation of the appendages. Importantly, many of the signaling pathways and patterning genes identified and characterized in Drosophila have similar functions during vertebrate appendage development. In this review, we will summarize the genetic and molecular mechanisms that lead to the specification of appendage primordia in the embryo and their posterior patterning during imaginal disc development. The identification of the regulatory logic underlying appendage specification in Drosophila suggests that the evolutionary origin of the insect wing is, in part, related to the development of ventral appendages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruiz-Losada","given":"Mireya"},{"family":"Blom-Dahl","given":"David"},{"family":"Córdoba","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Estella","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"ruiz-losada2018","container-title":"Journal of Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.3390/jdb6030017","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"17","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Specification and Patterning of Drosophila Appendages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2221-3759/6/3/17","volume":"6"},

The second PHD ﬁnger of human BPTF is known to speciﬁcally recognize histone H3 when methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3). Here, we examine how additional heterotypic modiﬁcations inﬂuence BPTF binding. Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentiﬁed for a PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a unique trans-histone modiﬁcation pattern that unambiguously resides within a single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these marks in the genome.

BAP1 promotes DEUBAD monoubiquitination resulting in an increased stability of ASXL2, which in turn stimulates BAP1 DUB activity. ASXL2 monoubiquitination is directly catalyzed by UBE2E family of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and regulates mammalian cell proliferation. Remarkably, Calypso also regulates Asx monoubiquitination and transgenic flies expressing monoubiquitination-defective Asx mutant exhibit developmental defects. Finally, the protein levels of ASXL2, BAP1 and UBE2E enzymes are highly correlated in mesothelioma tumors suggesting the importance of this signaling axis for tumor suppression.

However, the mechanisms underlying euchromatin establishment during early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is maintained from oocytes to fertilized embryos in Drosophila and mammals. H4K16ac forms large domains that control nucleosome accessibility of promoters prior to ZGA in flies. Maternal depletion of MOF acetyltransferase leading to H4K16ac loss causes aberrant RNA Pol II recruitment, compromises the 3D organization of the active genomic compartments during ZGA, and causes downregulation of post-zygotically expressed genes. Germline depletion of histone deacetylases revealed that other acetyl marks cannot compensate for H4K16ac loss in the oocyte. Moreover, zygotic re-expression of MOF was neither able to restore embryonic viability nor onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. Thus, maternal H4K16ac provides an instructive function to the offspring, priming future gene activation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Samata","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Alexiadis","given":"Anastasios"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Gautier"},{"family":"Georgiev","given":"Plamen"},{"family":"Nuebler","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Tanvi"},{"family":"Renschler","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Basilicata","given":"M.

  {"id":"sankar2022","abstract":"Posttranslational modifications of histones (PTMs) are associated with specific chromatin and gene expression states1,2. Although studies in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed phenotypic associations between chromatin-modifying enzymes and their histone substrates, comparable studies in mammalian models do not exist3–5. Here, we use CRISPR base editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to address the regulatory role of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), a substrate for Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated methylation and CBP/EP300-mediated acetylation6,7. By generating pan-H3K27R (pK27R) mutant mESCs, where all 28 alleles of H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3 have been mutated, we demonstrate similarity in transcription patterns of genes and differentiation to PRC2-null mutants. Moreover, H3K27 acetylation is not essential for gene derepression linked to loss of H3K27 methylation, or de novo activation of genes during cell-fate transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). In conclusion, our results show that H3K27 is an essential substrate for PRC2 in mESCs, whereas other PTMs in addition to H3K27 acetylation are likely involved in mediating CBP/EP300 function. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale multicopy gene editing to interrogate histone PTM function in mammalian cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sankar","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Mohammad","given":"Faizaan"},{"family":"Sundaramurthy","given":"Arun Kumar"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Lerdrup","given":"Mads"},{"family":"Tatar","given":"Tulin"},{"family":"Helin","given":"Kristian"}],"citation-key":"sankar2022","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-022-01091-2","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"6","page":"754-760","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Histone editing elucidates the functional roles of H3K27 methylation and acetylation in mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01091-2","volume":"54"},

We provide the evidence that coordinated recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to CCND2 involves a combination of a specialized PRC1 targeting element (PTE) and an adjacent CpG-island, which together act as a human Polycomb Response Element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of CCND2 in different transcriptional states indicates that histone modifications produced by PRC1 and PRC2 are not sufficient to recruit either of the complexes. However, catalytic activity of PRC2 helps to anchor PRC1 at the PTE.

Mutation of the core PRC1 component Ring1 in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including Hox transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in Ring1 mutants is due to the suppression of Hox-dependent specification programs by derepressed Hox13 paralogs (Hoxa13, Hoxb13, Hoxc13, Hoxd13).

Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood.

We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode’s food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode’s neurons signal via TGFb-insulin/ IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiffer","given":"Jodie A"},{"family":"Servello","given":"Francesco A"},{"family":"Heath","given":"William R"},{"family":"Amrit","given":"Francis Raj Gandhi"},{"family":"Stumbur","given":"Stephanie V"},{"family":"Eder","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Olivier MF"},{"family":"Johnsen","given":"Sean B"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"Julian A"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Sarah J"},{"family":"McGowan","given":"Natalie G"},{"family":"Vogelaar","given":"Abigail L"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuyan"},{"family":"Serkin","given":"William T"},{"family":"Ghazi","given":"Arjumand"},{"family":"Stroustrup","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Apfeld","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"schiffer2020","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.56186","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,5]]},"language":"en","page":"e56186","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Caenorhabditis elegans processes sensory information to choose between freeloading and self-defense strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/56186","volume":"9"},

Here we describe a modular system entitled CRISPaint (CRISPR-assisted insertion tagging) that allows precise and efficient integration of large heterologous DNA cassettes into eukaryotic genomes. CRISPaint makes use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce a double-strand break (DSB) at a user-defined genomic location. A universal donor DNA, optionally provided as minicircle DNA, is cleaved simultaneously to be integrated at the genomic DSB, while processing the donor plasmid at three possible positions allows flexible reading-frame selection. Applying this system allows to create C-terminal tag fusions of endogenously encoded proteins in human cells with high efficiencies. Knocking out known DSB repair components reveals that site-specific insertion is completely dependent on canonical NHEJ (DNA-PKcs, XLF and ligase-4).

  {"id":"schmitt2005","abstract":"Polycomb group response elements (PREs) mediate the mitotic inheritance of gene expression programs and thus maintain determined cell fates. By default, PREs silence associated genes via the targeting of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes. Upon an activating signal, however, PREs recruit counteracting trithorax group (trxG) proteins, which in turn maintain target genes in a transcriptionally active state. Using a transgenic reporter system, we show that the switch from the silenced to the activated state of a PRE requires noncoding transcription. Continuous transcription through the PRE induced by an actin promoter prevents the establishment of PcG-mediated silencing. The maintenance of epigenetic activation requires transcription through the PRE to proceed at least until embryogenesis is completed. At the homeotic bithorax complex of Drosophila, intergenic PRE transcripts can be detected not only during embryogenesis, but also at late larval stages, suggesting that transcription through endogenous PREs is required continuously as an anti-silencing mechanism to prevent the access of repressive PcG complexes to the chromatin. Furthermore, all other PREs outside the homeotic complex we tested were found to be transcribed in the same tissue as the mRNA of the corresponding target gene, suggesting that anti-silencing by transcription is a fundamental aspect of the cellular memory system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Prestel","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Paro","given":"Renato"}],"citation-key":"schmitt2005","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.326205","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"697-708","PMID":"15741315","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"Intergenic transcription through a Polycomb group response element counteracts silencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/6/697","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"schroeder2004","abstract":"The segmentation gene network of Drosophila consists of maternal and zygotic factors that generate, by transcriptional (cross-) regulation, expression patterns of increasing complexity along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Using known binding site information for maternal and zygotic gap transcription factors, the computer algorithm Ahab recovers known segmentation control elements (modules) with excellent success and predicts many novel modules within the network and genome-wide. We show that novel module predictions are highly enriched in the network and typically clustered proximal to the promoter, not only upstream, but also in intronic space and downstream. When placed upstream of a reporter gene, they consistently drive patterned blastoderm expression, in most cases faithfully producing one or more pattern elements of the endogenous gene. Moreover, we demonstrate for the entire set of known and newly validated modules that Ahab's prediction of binding sites correlates well with the expression patterns produced by the modules, revealing basic rules governing their composition. Specifically, we show that maternal factors consistently act as activators and that gap factors act as repressors, except for the bimodal factor Hunchback. Our data suggest a simple context-dependent rule for its switch from repressive to activating function. Overall, the composition of modules appears well fitted to the spatiotemporal distribution of their positive and negative input factors. Finally, by comparing Ahab predictions with different categories of transcription factor input, we confirm the global regulatory structure of the segmentation gene network, but find odd skipped behaving like a primary pair-rule gene. The study expands our knowledge of the segmentation gene network by increasing the number of experimentally tested modules by 50%. For the first time, the entire set of validated modules is analyzed for binding site composition under a uniform set of criteria, permitting the definition of basic composition rules. The study demonstrates that computational methods are a powerful complement to experimental approaches in the analysis of transcription networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fak","given":"John"},{"family":"Fan","given":"HongQing"},{"family":"Unnerstall","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Emberly","given":"Eldon"},{"family":"Rajewsky","given":"Nikolaus"},{"family":"Siggia","given":"Eric D."},{"family":"Gaul","given":"Ulrike"}],"citation-key":"schroeder2004","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.0020271","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"e271","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Transcriptional Control in the Segmentation Gene Network of Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020271","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"schuettengruber2009a","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that regulate key developmental genes throughout development. In Drosophila, PcG and trxG factors bind to regulatory DNA elements called PcG and trxG response elements (PREs and TREs). Several DNA binding proteins have been suggested to recruit PcG proteins to PREs, but the DNA sequences necessary and sufficient to define PREs are largely unknown. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip assays to map the chromosomal distribution of Drosophila PcG proteins, the N- and C-terminal fragments of the Trithorax (TRX) protein and four candidate DNA-binding factors for PcG recruitment. In addition, we mapped histone modifications associated with PcG-dependent silencing and TRX-mediated activation. PcG proteins colocalize in large regions that may be defined as polycomb domains and colocalize with recruiters to form several hundreds of putative PREs. Strikingly, the majority of PcG recruiter binding sites are associated with H3K4me3 and not with PcG binding, suggesting that recruiter proteins have a dual function in activation as well as silencing. One major discriminant between activation and silencing is the strong binding of Pleiohomeotic (PHO) to silenced regions, whereas its homolog Pleiohomeotic-like (PHOL) binds preferentially to active promoters. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of TRX (TRX-C) showed high affinity to PcG binding sites, whereas the N-terminal fragment (TRX-N) bound mainly to active promoter regions trimethylated on H3K4. Our results indicate that DNA binding proteins serve as platforms to assist PcG and trxG binding. Furthermore, several DNA sequence features discriminate between PcG- and TRX-N–bound regions, indicating that underlying DNA sequence contains critical information to drive PREs and TREs towards silencing or activation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuettengruber","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Ganapathi","given":"Mythily"},{"family":"Leblanc","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Portoso","given":"Manuela"},{"family":"Jaschek","given":"Rami"},{"family":"Tolhuis","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Lohuizen","given":"Maarten","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Tanay","given":"Amos"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Giacomo"}],"citation-key":"schuettengruber2009a","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1000013","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,13]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000013","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Functional Anatomy of Polycomb and Trithorax Chromatin Landscapes in Drosophila Embryos","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000013","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"schwartz2010","abstract":"Polycomb (PcG) regulation has been thought to produce stable long-term gene silencing. Genomic analyses in Drosophila and mammals, however, have shown that it targets many genes, which can switch state during development. Genetic evidence indicates that critical for the active state of PcG target genes are the histone methyltransferases Trithorax (TRX) and ASH1. Here we analyze the repertoire of alternative states in which PcG target genes are found in different Drosophila cell lines and the role of PcG proteins TRX and ASH1 in controlling these states. Using extensive genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, RNAi knockdowns, and quantitative RT–PCR, we show that, in addition to the known repressed state, PcG targets can reside in a transcriptionally active state characterized by formation of an extended domain enriched in ASH1, the N-terminal, but not C-terminal moiety of TRX and H3K27ac. ASH1/TRX N-ter domains and transcription are not incompatible with repressive marks, sometimes resulting in a “balanced” state modulated by both repressors and activators. Often however, loss of PcG repression results instead in a “void” state, lacking transcription, H3K27ac, or binding of TRX or ASH1. We conclude that PcG repression is dynamic, not static, and that the propensity of a target gene to switch states depends on relative levels of PcG, TRX, and activators. N-ter TRX plays a remarkable role that antagonizes PcG repression and preempts H3K27 methylation by acetylation. This role is distinct from that usually attributed to TRX/MLL proteins at the promoter. These results have important implications for Polycomb gene regulation, the “bivalent” chromatin state of embryonic stem cells, and gene expression in development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Yuri B."},{"family":"Kahn","given":"Tatyana G."},{"family":"Stenberg","given":"Per"},{"family":"Ohno","given":"Katsuhito"},{"family":"Bourgon","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Pirrotta","given":"Vincenzo"}],"citation-key":"schwartz2010","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1000805","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000805","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Alternative Epigenetic Chromatin States of Polycomb Target Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000805","volume":"6"},

A conserved Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph) has been shown to play an important role in chromatin compaction and large-scale chromatin organization. Ph SAM forms helical head to tail polymers, and SAM-SAM interactions between chromatin-bound Ph/PRC1 are believed to compact chromatin and mediate long-range interactions. To understand the underlying mechanism, here we analyze the effects of Ph SAM on chromatin in vitro. We find that incubation of chromatin or DNA with a truncated Ph protein containing the SAM results in formation of concentrated, phase-separated condensates. Ph SAM-dependent condensates can recruit PRC1 from extracts and enhance PRC1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards histone H2A. We show that overexpression of Ph with an intact SAM increases ubiquitylated H2A in cells. Thus, SAM-induced phase separation, in the context of Ph, can mediate large-scale compaction of chromatin into biochemical compartments that facilitate histone modification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Seif","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Jin Joo"},{"family":"Sasseville","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Senkovich","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Kaltashov","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Boulier","given":"Elodie L."},{"family":"Kapur","given":"Ibani"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Chongwoo A."},{"family":"Francis","given":"Nicole J."}],"citation-key":"seif2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-19435-z","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Enzyme mechanisms;Histone post-translational modifications;Ligases;Ubiquitylated proteins;Ubiquitylation\nSubject_term_id: enzyme-mechanisms;histone-post-translational-modifications;ligases;ubiquitylated-proteins;ubiquitylation","number":"1","page":"5609","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Phase separation by the polyhomeotic sterile alpha motif compartmentalizes Polycomb Group proteins and enhances their activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19435-z","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"seller2019","abstract":"Acquisition of chromatin modifications during embryogenesis distinguishes different regions of an initially naïve genome. In many organisms, repetitive DNA is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin that is marked by di/trimethylation of histone H3K9 and the associated protein HP1a. These modifications enforce the unique epigenetic properties of heterochromatin. However, in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, the heterochromatin lacks these modifications, which appear only later, when rapid embryonic cell cycles slow down at the midblastula transition (MBT). Here we focus on the initial steps restoring heterochromatic modifications in the embryo. We describe the JabbaTrap, a technique for inactivating maternally provided proteins in embryos. Using the JabbaTrap, we reveal a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin. In contrast, other methyltransferases contribute minimally. Live imaging reveals that endogenous Eggless gradually accumulates on chromatin in interphase but then dissociates in mitosis, and its accumulation must restart in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle slowing as the embryo approaches the MBT permits increasing accumulation and action of Eggless at its targets. Experimental manipulation of interphase duration shows that cell cycle speed regulates Eggless. We propose that developmental slowing of the cell cycle times embryonic heterochromatin formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Seller","given":"Charles A."},{"family":"Cho","given":"Chun-Yi"},{"family":"O'Farrell","given":"Patrick H."}],"citation-key":"seller2019","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.321646.118","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"7-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"403-417","PMID":"30808658","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"Rapid embryonic cell cycles defer the establishment of heterochromatin by Eggless/SetDB1 in Drosophila","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/7-8/403","volume":"33"},

We demonstrate that PcG targets coalesce in vivo, and that developmentally induced expression of one of the target loci disrupts this spatial arrangement.

  {"id":"shihchiehliang2015","abstract":"The Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes play crucial roles in development by regulating expression of homeotic and other genes controlling cell fate. Both groups catalyse modifications of chromatin, particularly histone methylation, leading to epigenetic changes that affect gene activity. The trxG antagonizes the function of PcG genes by activating PcG target genes, and consequently trxG mutants suppress PcG mutant phenotypes. We previously identified the ANTAGONIST OF LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (ALP1) gene as a genetic suppressor of mutants in the Arabidopsis PcG gene LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). Here, we show that ALP1 interacts genetically with several other PcG and trxG components and that it antagonizes PcG silencing. Transcriptional profiling reveals that when PcG activity is compromised numerous target genes are hyper-activated in seedlings and that in most cases this requires ALP1. Furthermore, when PcG activity is present ALP1 is needed for full activation of several floral homeotic genes that are repressed by the PcG. Strikingly, ALP1 does not encode a known chromatin protein but rather a protein related to PIF/Harbinger class transposases. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ALP1 is broadly conserved in land plants and likely lost transposase activity and acquired a novel function during angiosperm evolution. Consistent with this, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) show that ALP1 associates, in vivo, with core components of POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2), a widely conserved PcG protein complex which functions as a H3K27me3 histone methyltransferase. Furthermore, in reciprocal pulldowns using the histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF), we identify not only ALP1 and the core PRC2 components but also plant-specific accessory components including EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF1), a transcriptional repressor previously associated with PRC1-like complexes. Taken together our data suggest that ALP1 inhibits PcG silencing by blocking the interaction of the core PRC2 with accessory components that promote its HMTase activity or its role in inhibiting transcription. ALP1 is the first example of a domesticated transposase acquiring a novel function as a PcG component. The antagonistic interaction of a modified transposase with the PcG machinery is novel and may have arisen as a means for the cognate transposon to evade host surveillance or for the host to exploit features of the transposition machinery beneficial for epigenetic regulation of gene activity.","author":[{"literal":"Shih Chieh Liang"},{"literal":"Ben Hartwig"},{"literal":"Pumi Perera"},{"literal":"Santiago Mora-García"},{"literal":"Erica S. de Leau"},{"literal":"Harry Thornton"},{"literal":"Flavia de Lima Alves"},{"literal":"Flavia Lima de Alves"},{"literal":"Juri Rapsilber"},{"literal":"Juri Rappsilber"},{"literal":"Suxin Yang"},{"literal":"Geo Velikkakam James"},{"literal":"Korbinian Schneeberger"},{"literal":"E.

However, the precise chromatin loci of functional H3K27me3 marks are not yet known. Here we identify critical PRC2 functional sites at a single nucleosome resolution. We fused a computationally designed protein, EED binder (EB) that competes with EZH2 and thereby disrupts PRC2 function, to dCas9 (EBdCas9) to direct PRC2 inhibition at a precise locus using gRNA. We targeted EBdCas9 to 4 different genes (TBX18, p16, CDX2 and GATA3) and observed epigenetic remodeling at a single nucleosome resolution resulting in gene activation. Remarkably, while traditional TATA box is located 30bp upstream of TSS, we identified a functional TATA box, >500bp of TSS, normally repressed by PRC2 complex. Deletion of this TATA box eliminates EBdCas9 dependent TBP recruitment and transcriptional activation. Targeting EBdCas9 to CDX2 and GATA3 results in trophoblast trans-differentiation. EBdCas9 technology is broadly applicable for epigenetic regulation at a single locus to control gene expression.

  {"id":"shlyueva2014","abstract":"The development of all organisms relies on differential gene expression, which is controlled by genomic regions called enhancers or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Recent studies highlight the importance of enhancers in evolution and disease; however, our understanding of their properties and functions remains incomplete.Enhancers contain short DNA sequences, which are binding sites for transcription factors. In turn, transcription factors recruit cofactors, which modify the nearby chromatin and lead to transcriptional activation.The location of putative enhancers can be predicted genome wide by assessing either the binding of transcription factors and cofactors or post-translational histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP–seq). 'Open' chromatin with accessible DNA can be detected by DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by deep sequencing (FAIRE–seq) or assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq).Distal enhancers can activate target gene expression by looping to promoters. Such spatial contacts can be detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and its variants circular chromosome conformation capture (4C), chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) and Hi-C methods or by chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA–PET, which is a combination of ChIP and various 3C-based methods).The genome-wide prediction of enhancers based on characteristic chromatin features is powerful, but such results have to be interpreted with caution because none of the known features is perfectly predictive.Enhancer activities of candidate sequences can be measured directly in a developmental context using image-based readouts or enhancer-FACS-seq. High-throughput parallel enhancer assays use either ectopic reporters to test thousands of candidates (which are based on DNA barcodes) or genome-wide screens (such as self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)).Our understanding of enhancer biology will be further accelerated by advances in genome editing methods (such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)–Cas9 system), as well as by the development or improvements of methods to assess gene expression, chromatin state and structure in entire genomes and from increasingly few cells (such as thousands of reporters integrated in parallel (TRIP), single-cell RNA sequencing or ChIP–seq, and high-resolution Hi-C).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Shlyueva","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Stampfel","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"shlyueva2014","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10/f3swzg","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4]]},"language":"en","license":"2014 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  {"id":"shoaib2021","abstract":"Histone lysine methylations have primarily been linked to selective recruitment of reader or effector proteins that subsequently modify chromatin regions and mediate genome functions. Here, we describe a divergent role for histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) and demonstrate that it directly facilitates chromatin openness and accessibility by disrupting chromatin folding. Thus, accumulation of H4K20me1 demarcates highly accessible chromatin at genes, and this is maintained throughout the cell cycle. In vitro, H4K20me1-containing nucleosomal arrays with nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL) of 187 and 197 are less compact than unmethylated (H4K20me0) or trimethylated (H4K20me3) arrays. Concordantly, and in contrast to trimethylated and unmethylated tails, solid-state NMR data shows that H4K20 mono-methylation changes the H4 conformational state and leads to more dynamic histone H4-tails. Notably, the increased chromatin accessibility mediated by H4K20me1 facilitates gene expression, particularly of housekeeping genes. Altogether, we show how the methylation state of a single histone H4 residue operates as a focal point in chromatin structure control. While H4K20me1 directly promotes chromatin openness at highly transcribed genes, it also serves as a stepping-stone for H4K20me3-dependent chromatin compaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Shoaib","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qinming"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Xiangyan"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Nidhi"},{"family":"Prasanna","given":"Chinmayi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Renliang"},{"family":"Walter","given":"David"},{"family":"Frederiksen","given":"Klaus S."},{"family":"Einarsson","given":"Hjorleifur"},{"family":"Svensson","given":"J.

RESULTS We directly test the requirement of H2Aub for gene regulation in Marchantia polymorpha by generating point mutations in H2A that prevent ubiquitination by PRC1. These mutants show reduced H3K27me3 levels on the same target sites as mutants defective in PRC1 subunits MpBMI1 and the homolog MpBMI1L, revealing that PRC1-catalyzed H2Aub is essential for Polycomb system function. Furthermore, by comparing transcriptome data between mutants in MpH2A and MpBMI1/1L, we demonstrate that H2Aub contributes to the PRC1-mediated transcriptional level of genes and transposable elements.

  {"id":"shumeng2016","abstract":"Rationale:   We have previously shown that innate immunity is necessary for transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to endothelial cells. A major signaling molecule involved in innate immunity is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Accordingly, we hypothesized that iNOS-generated nitric oxide (NO) might enhance transdifferentiation.     Objective:   To elucidate the role of NO in epigenetic plasticity during transdifferentiation.     Methods and Results:   We exposed the BJ fibroblasts to transdifferentiation formulation that included endothelial growth factors and innate immune activator polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC) to induce endothelial cells (iECs). Generation of iECs was associated with iNOS expression and NO elaboration. In absence of PIC, or in presence of antagonists of NFκB or iNOS activity, NO synthesis and iEC generation was reduced. Furthermore, genetic knockout (in MEFs) or siRNA knockdown (in BJ fibroblasts) of iNOS nearly abolished transdifferentiation, an effect which could be reversed by iNOS overexpression. Notably, PIC induced nuclear localization of iNOS, and its binding to, and nitrosylation of, the epigenetic modifier RING1A as assessed by immunostaining, Co-IP and mass spectrometry. Nitrosylation of RING1A reduced its binding to chromatin, and reduced global levels of repressive histone marker H3K27trimethylation. Overexpression of a mutant form of RING1A (C398A) lacking the nitrosylation site almost abrogated transdifferentiation.     Conclusions:   Overall, our data indicates that during transdifferentiation, innate immune activation increases iNOS generation of NO to S-nitrosylate RING1A, a key member of the polycomb repressive complex. Nitrosylation of RING1A reduces its binding to chromatin and decreases H3K27trimethylation level. The release of epigenetic repression by nitrosylation of RING1A is critical for effective transdifferentiation.","author":[{"literal":"Shu Meng"},{"literal":"Gang Zhou"},{"literal":"Qilin Gu"},{"literal":"Palas K.

  {"id":"siddharthan2010","abstract":"Background: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in silico is key in understanding gene regulation. TFBS are string patterns that exhibit some variability, commonly modelled as ‘‘position weight matrices’’ (PWMs). Though convenient, the PWM has significant limitations, in particular the assumed independence of positions within the binding motif; and predictions based on PWMs are usually not very specific to known functional sites. Analysis here on binding sites in yeast suggests that correlation of dinucleotides is not limited to near-neighbours, but can extend over considerable gaps.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: I describe a straightforward generalization of the PWM model, that considers frequencies of dinucleotides instead of individual nucleotides. Unlike previous efforts, this method considers all dinucleotides within an extended binding region, and does not make an attempt to determine a priori the significance of particular dinucleotide correlations. I describe how to use a ‘‘dinucleotide weight matrix’’ (DWM) to predict binding sites, dealing in particular with the complication that its entries are not independent probabilities. Benchmarks show, for many factors, a dramatic improvement over PWMs in precision of predicting known targets. In most cases, significant further improvement arises by extending the commonly defined ‘‘core motifs’’ by about 10bp on either side. Though this flanking sequence shows no strong motif at the nucleotide level, the predictive power of the dinucleotide model suggests that the ‘‘signature’’ in DNA sequence of protein-binding affinity extends beyond the core protein-DNA contact region.\nConclusion/Significance: While computationally more demanding and slower than PWM-based approaches, this dinucleotide method is straightforward, both conceptually and in implementation, and can serve as a basis for future improvements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Siddharthan","given":"Rahul"}],"citation-key":"siddharthan2010","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0009722","editor":[{"family":"Khanin","given":"Raya"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e9722","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dinucleotide Weight Matrices for Predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites: Generalizing the Position Weight Matrix","title-short":"Dinucleotide Weight Matrices for Predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009722","volume":"5"},

This concept has its merits and its pitfalls. Among the merits is the notion, elicited by the combined two terms of (i) aerobic metabolism as a steady-state redox balance and (ii) the associated potential strains in the balance as denoted by the term, stress, evoking biological stress responses. Current research on molecular redox switches governing oxidative stress responses is in full bloom. The fundamental importance of linking redox shifts to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling is being more fully appreciated, thanks to major advances in methodology. Among the pitfalls is the fact that the underlying molecular details are to be worked out in each particular case, which is bvious for a global concept, but which is sometimes overlooked. This can lead to indiscriminate use of the term, oxidative stress, without clear relation to redox chemistry. The major role in antioxidant defense is fulﬁlled by antioxidant enzymes, not by small-molecule antioxidant compounds.

In every case, both abdA and AbdB are expressed outside of their normal domains along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis, consistent with these Pc group products acting in a single pathway or molecular complex. The earliest detectable ectopic expression is highest in the parasegments immediately adjacent to the normal expression boundary. Surprisingly, in the most severe Pc group mutants, the earliest ectopic AbdB is distributed in a pair-rule pattern. At all stages, ectopic abdA in the epidermis is highest along the anterior edges of the parasegments, in a pattern that mimics the normal abdA cell-specific pattern. These examples of highly patterned mis-expression show that Pc group mutations do not cause indiscriminate activation of homeotic products. We suggest that the ectopic expression patterns result from factors that normally activate abdA and AbdB only in certain parasegments, but that in Pc group mutants these factors gain access to regulatory DNA in all parasegments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"J."},{"family":"Chiang","given":"A."},{"family":"Bender","given":"W."}],"citation-key":"simon1992","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.114.2.493","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992,2,1]]},"page":"493-505","source":"Silverchair","title":"Ten different Polycomb group genes are required for spatial control of the abdA and AbdB homeotic products","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.114.2.493","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"simonetamburri2019","abstract":"The major function of Polycomb group proteins (PcG) is to maintain transcriptional repression to preserve cellular identity. This is exerted by two distinct repressive complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, that modify histones by depositing H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively. Both complexes are essential for development and are deregulated in several types of human tumors. PRC1 and PRC2 exist in different variants and show a complex regulatory cross-talk. However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Coupling an inducible system with the expression of a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target genes repressed in ESC. Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This affected both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 variants and further correlated with a strong displacement and destabilization of canonical PRC1. Finally, we find that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as central hub that mount PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity.","author":[{"literal":"Simone Tamburri"},{"literal":"Elisa Lavarone"},{"literal":"Daniel Fernández-Pérez"},{"literal":"Marika Zanotti"},{"literal":"Daria Manganaro"},{"literal":"Eric Conway"},{"literal":"Eric Conway"},{"literal":"Diego Pasini"}],"citation-key":"simonetamburri2019","container-title":"bioRxiv","container-title-short":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/690461","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Histone H2AK119 Mono-Ubiquitination is Essential for Polycomb-Mediated Transcriptional Repression","type":"article-journal"},

CUT&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling.

Inactivation of PRC1 in male germ cells results in the gradual loss of a stem cell population and severe differentiation defects, leading to male infertility. In the stem cell population, RNF2, the dominant catalytic subunit of PRC1, activates transcription of Sall4, which codes for a transcription factor essential for subsequent spermatogenic differentiation. Furthermore, RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy transcription start sites of germline genes in the stem cell population. Once differentiation commences, these germline genes are activated to enable the progression of spermatogenesis.

The protocol can be used to dissect imaginal discs from younger first and second instar larvae as well. The advantage of this protocol is that it is relatively short and it has been optimized for the high quality preservation of the dissected tissue. Another advantage is that the fixation procedure that is employed works well with the overwhelming number of antibodies that recognize Drosophila proteins. In our experience, there is a very small number of sensitive antibodies that do not work well with this procedure. In these situations, the remedy appears to be to use an alternate fixation cocktail while continuing to follow the guidelines that we have set forth for the dissection steps and antibody incubations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Spratford","given":"Carrie M."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Justin P."}],"citation-key":"spratford2014","container-title":"Journal of Visualized Experiments : JoVE","container-title-short":"J Vis Exp","DOI":"10/ghdr2d","ISSN":"1940-087X","issue":"91","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,20]]},"PMCID":"PMC4542997","PMID":"25285379","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Dissection and Immunostaining of Imaginal Discs from Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542997/"},

By utilizing glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling as a model system, we uncovered striking spatiotemporal relationships between receptor loading, lifetimes of the DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs), long-range interactions, and gene regulation. We found that hormone-induced DHSs were enriched within ±50 kb of GR-responsive genes and displayed a broad spectrum of lifetimes upon hormone withdrawal. These lifetimes dictate the strength of the DHS interactions with gene targets and contribute to gene regulation from a distance. Our results demonstrate that pulsatile and constant hormone stimulations induce unique, treatment-specific patterns of gene and regulatory element activation. These modes of activation have implications for corticosteroid function in vivo and for steroid therapies in various clinical settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stavreva","given":"Diana A."},{"family":"Coulon","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Baek","given":"Songjoon"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Myong-Hee"},{"family":"John","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Stixova","given":"Lenka"},{"family":"Tesikova","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Hakim","given":"Ofir"},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Stamatoyannopoulos","given":"John A."},{"family":"Chow","given":"Carson C."},{"family":"Hager","given":"Gordon L."}],"citation-key":"stavreva2015","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.184168.114","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"845-857","PMID":"25677181","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Dynamics of chromatin accessibility and long-range interactions in response to glucocorticoid pulsing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/6/845","volume":"25"},

Here, we performed sequence analysis of a regulatory upstream section of MEF2C in T-ALL cell lines which, however, proved devoid of mutations. Unexpectedly, we found strong conservation between the regulatory upstream region of MEF2C (located at chromosomal band 5q14) and an intergenic stretch at 7q11 located between STAG3L4 and AUTS2, covering nearly 20 kb. While the non-coding gene STAG3L4 was inconspicuously expressed, AUTS2 was aberrantly upregulated in 6% of T-ALL patients (public dataset GSE42038) and in 3/24 T-ALL cell lines, two of which represented very immature differentiation stages. AUTS2 expression was higher in normal B-cells than in T-cells, indicating lineage-specific activity in lymphopoiesis. While excluding chromosomal aberrations, examinations of AUTS2 transcriptional regulation in T-ALL cells revealed activation by IL7-IL7R-STAT5-signalling and MEF2C. AUTS2 protein has been shown to interact with polycomb repressor complex 1 subtype 5 (PRC1.5), transforming this particular complex into an activator. Accordingly, expression profiling and functional analyses demonstrated that AUTS2 activated while PCGF5 repressed transcription of NKL homeobox gene MSX1 in T-ALL cells. Forced expression and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in addition to H3K27me3 analysis indicated that PRC2 repressed MSX1 as well. Taken together, we found that AUTS2 and MEF2C, despite lying on different chromosomes, share strikingly similar regulatory upstream regions and aberrant expression in T-ALL subsets. Our data implicate chromatin complexes PRC1/AUTS2 and PRC2 in a gene network in T-ALL regulating early lymphoid differentiation.","author":[{"literal":"Stefan Nagel"},{"literal":"Claudia Pommerenke"},{"literal":"Corinna Meyer"},{"literal":"Maren Kaufmann"},{"literal":"Hans G.

  {"id":"steffen2014","abstract":"The conserved Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are transcriptional regulators, with several hundred target genes. Disruption of PcG or TrxG protein function can cause developmental defects and cancer.The PcG and TrxG proteins are recruited to cis-regulatory elements called Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs). The PcG and TrxG proteins act antagonistically through PREs to maintain silent and active gene expression states, respectively. These states are initiated by transcription factors that act at enhancers and are maintained by PcG and TrxG proteins at the PRE.Epigenetic memory is defined as the maintenance of gene expression states through cell generations in the absence of the initiating signals. PREs were first discovered in flies, in which they can mediate epigenetic memory of both silent and active states of their associated genes. Epigenetic memory has not yet been tested for mammalian PREs.Silent and activated states are each ensured by several self-reinforcing molecular mechanisms that act on chromatin and are mediated by the PcG and TrxG proteins. These include covalent modifications of chromatin, structural changes and modulation of RNA polymerase II activity. Mechanisms of silencing and activation antagonize each other.During the cell cycle, replication and mitosis are the stages at which epigenetic memory is most likely to be erased. Each stage presents a different molecular challenge to memory.During replication, newly assembled chromatin is acetylated and may favour an active PRE but challenge a silent one. Several PcG and TrxG proteins remain bound to replicating chromatin and may transmit memory to daughter strands.During mitosis, many proteins dissociate from chromatin and transcription shuts down. This may favour a silent PRE but challenge an active one. Several PcG and TrxG proteins remain bound to mitotic chromatin and may 'bookmark' silent and active states.Many PcG and TrxG target genes are dynamically regulated during development and do not display long-term epigenetic memory. For these targets, the PcG and TrxG proteins may reinforce or amplify transcriptional levels over shorter timescales. This may add robustness to gene regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Philipp A."},{"family":"Ringrose","given":"Leonie"}],"citation-key":"steffen2014","container-title":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","DOI":"10.1038/nrm3789","ISSN":"1471-0080","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2014 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

DHS patterns alone convey rich information about cell fate and lineage relationships distinct from information conveyed by gene expression. Developing cells share a proportion of their DHS landscapes with ESCs; that proportion decreases continuously in each cell type as differentiation progresses, providing a quantitative benchmark of developmental maturity. Developmentally stable DHSs densely encode binding sites for transcription factors involved in autoregulatory feedback circuits. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells extensively reactivate silenced ESC DHSs and those from developmental programs external to the cell lineage from which the malignancy derives.

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate.

We find that the esc’ gene product is required during a discrete period of embryogenesis. If the gene product is absent or inactive during this period, most segments develop like the eighth abdominal segment.

  {"id":"struhl1985","abstract":"The product of the extra sex combs (esc) gene is required early in embryogenesis to ensure the correct spatial expression of the bithorax and Antennapedia gene complexes during subsequent development. Here we describe the spatial and temporal patterns of transcription of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene in mutant esc embryos. In wild-type embryos, Ubx transcripts are first detected in the blastoderm primorida of particular thoracic and abdominal segments, predominately in a band of cells constituting the progenitor cells of parasegment 6: after gastrulation, high levels of transcript accumulate in a sharply restricted region of the germ band comprising parasegments 6-12. In esc- embryos, the initial pattern of Ubx transcripts appears indistinguishable from that of wild-type embryos. However, following gastrulation and germ band extension, Ubx transcripts accumulate in most of the ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives of the body, including those of all 14 parasegments. Then, the abundance of the transcripts declines so that after germ band shortening (12 h after fertilization), only low levels are detected in each parasegment. These results show that the esc gene product is not involved in choosing where the Ubx gene is to be expressed, but rather, that it acts subsequently to ensure that the gene remains off in those primordia in which it is not initially activated. In addition, they suggest the possibility that other homeotic genes may regulate Ubx expression --in this case, the accumulating products of other indiscriminately expressed homeotic genes serving to down-regulate Ubx transcription throughout the body.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Struhl","given":"G"},{"family":"Akam","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"struhl1985","container-title":"The EMBO Journal","container-title-short":"EMBO J","ISSN":"0261-4189","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[1985,12,1]]},"page":"3259-3264","PMCID":"PMC554652","PMID":"2419125","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Altered distributions of Ultrabithorax transcripts in extra sex combs mutant embryos of Drosophila.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC554652/","volume":"4"},

Here we employ rapid degron-based depletion coupled with live-cell transcription imaging and single-particle tracking to uncover how the Polycomb system controls transcription in single cells. We discover that the Polycomb system is not a constitutive block to transcription but instead sustains a long-lived deep promoter OFF-state which limits the frequency with which the promoter can enter into a transcribing state. We demonstrate that Polycomb sustains this deep promoter OFF-state by counteracting the binding of factors that enable early transcription pre-initiation complex formation and show that this is necessary for gene repression.

  {"id":"t.2019","abstract":"Is it possible to  enjoy  both  economic  growth  and  environmental  sustainability?  This  question  is  a  matter  of  fierce  political  debate  between  green  growth  and  post-growth  advocates.  Over  the past  decade,  green  growth  clearly  dominated  policy-making  with  policy  agendas  at  the  United  Nations, European Union, and in numerous countries building on the assumption that decoupling environmental pressures from gross domestic product (GDP) could allow future economic growth without end. \n\nConsidering what is at stake, a careful assessment to determine whether the scientific foundations behind  this  “decoupling  hypothesis”  are  robust  or  not  is  needed.  This  report  reviews  the  empirical  and  theoretical  literature  to  assess  the  validity  of  this  hypothesis.  The  conclusion  is  both overwhelmingly clear and sobering: not only is there no empirical evidence supporting the existence of a decoupling of economic growth from environmental pressures on anywhere near the scale needed to deal with environmental breakdown, but also, and perhaps more importantly, such decoupling appears unlikely to happen in the future. \n\nIt is urgent to chart the consequences of these findings in terms of policy-making and prudently move  away  from  the  continuous  pursuit  of  economic  growth  in  high-consumption  countries.  More precisely, existing policy strategies aiming to increase efficiency have to be complemented by the pursuit of sufficiency, that is the direct downscaling of economic production in many sectors and parallel reduction of consumption that together will enable the good life within the planet’s ecological limits. In the view of the authors of this report and based on the best available scientific evidence, only such strategies respect the EU’s ‘precautionary principle’, the principle that when the stakes are high and the outcomes uncertain, one should err on the side of caution. \n\nThe fact that decoupling on its own, i.e. without addressing the issue of economic growth, has not been and will not be sufficient to reduce environmental pressures to the required extent is not a reason to oppose decoupling (in the literal sense of separating the environmental pressures curve from  the  GDP  curve)  or  the  measures  that  achieve  decoupling  -  on  the  contrary,  without  many  such  measures  the  situation  would  be  far  worse.  It  is  a  reason  to  have  major  concerns  about  the  predominant  focus  of  policymakers  on  green  growth,  this  focus  being  based  on  the  flawed assumption  that  sufficient  decoupling  can  be  achieved  through  increased  efficiency  without limiting economic production and consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"T.","given":"Parrique"},{"family":"J.","given":"Barth"},{"family":"F.","given":"Briens"},{"family":"Kerschener","given":"C."},{"family":"A.","given":"Kraus-Polk"},{"family":"A.","given":"Kuokkanen"},{"family":"J.

Therefore, maintenance of both the active and negative states of transcription is equally important.

However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Using a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target gene repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This preferentially affected PRC2.2 variant with respect to PRC2.1, destabilizing canonical PRC1 activity. Finally, we found that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched.

Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states.

  {"id":"tatavosian2019","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins repress master regulators of development and differentiation through organization of chromatin structure. Mutation and dysregulation of PcG genes cause developmental defects and cancer. PcG proteins form condensates in the cell nucleus, and these condensates are the physical sites of PcG-targeted gene silencing via formation of facultative heterochromatin. However, the physiochemical principles underlying the formation of PcG condensates remain unknown, and their determination could shed light on how these condensates compact chromatin. Using fluorescence live-cell imaging, we observed that the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) protein chromobox 2 (CBX2), a member of the CBX protein family, undergoes phase separation to form condensates and that the CBX2 condensates exhibit liquid-like properties. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the conserved residues of CBX2 within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is the region for compaction of chromatin in vitro, promote the condensate formation both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the CBX2 condensates concentrate DNA and nucleosomes. Using genetic engineering, we report that trimethylation of Lys-27 at histone H3 (H3K27me3), a marker of heterochromatin formation produced by PRC2, had minimal effects on the CBX2 condensate formation. We further demonstrated that the CBX2 condensate formation does not require CBX2–PRC1 subunits; however, the condensate formation of CBX2–PRC1 subunits depends on CBX2, suggesting a mechanism underlying the assembly of CBX2–PRC1 condensates. In summary, our results reveal that PcG condensates assemble through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and suggest that phase-separated condensates can organize PcG-bound chromatin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tatavosian","given":"Roubina"},{"family":"Kent","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Duc","given":"Huy Nguyen"},{"family":"Huynh","given":"Thao Ngoc"},{"family":"Zhen","given":"Chao Yu"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haobin"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiaojun"}],"citation-key":"tatavosian2019","container-title":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","container-title-short":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","DOI":"10.1074/jbc.RA118.006620","ISSN":"0021-9258","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1451-1463","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Nuclear condensates of the Polycomb protein chromobox 2 (CBX2) assemble through phase separation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820364565","volume":"294"},

  {"id":"terriente-felix2009","abstract":"Gene expression is regulated in part by protein complexes containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors of the SWI/SNF family. In Drosophila there is only one SWI/SNF protein, named Brahma, which forms the catalytic subunit of two complexes composed of different proteins. The protein Osa defines the BAP complex, and the proteins Polybromo and Bap170 are only present in the complex named PBAP. In this work we have analysed the functional requirements of Osa during Drosophila wing development, and found that osa is needed for cell growth and survival in the wing imaginal disc, and for the correct patterning of sensory organs, veins and the wing margin. Other members of the BAP complex, such as Snr1, Bap55, Mor and Brm, also share these functions of Osa. We focused on the requirement of Osa during the formation of the wing veins. Genetic interactions between osa alleles and mutations affecting the activity of the EGFR pathway suggest that one aspect of Osa is intimately related to the response to EGFR activity. Thus, loss of osa and EGFR signalling results in similar wing vein phenotypes, and osa alleles enhance the loss of veins caused by reduced EGFR activity. In addition, Osa is required for the expression of several targets of EGFR signalling, such as Delta, rhomboid and argos. We suggest that one role of Osa and Brm in the wing is to establish a chromatin environment in the regulatory regions of EGFR target genes, making them available for both activators and repressors and facilitating transcription in response to EGFR signalling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Terriente-Félix","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Celis","given":"Jose F.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"terriente-felix2009","container-title":"Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.03.010","ISSN":"0012-1606","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"350-361","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Osa, a subunit of the BAP chromatin-remodelling complex, participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to EGFR signalling in the Drosophila wing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160609001766","volume":"329"},

However, the mechanisms that temporally and spatially control the activation or repression of important genes during regeneration are not fully understood. To determine the role that chromatin modifiers play in regulating gene expression after tissue damage, we induced ablation in Drosophila melanogaster imaginal wing discs, and screened for chromatin regulators that are required for epithelial tissue regeneration. Here, we show that many of these genes are indeed important for promoting or constraining regeneration. Specifically, the two SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes play distinct roles in regulating different aspects of regeneration. The PBAP complex regulates regenerative growth and developmental timing, and is required for the expression of JNK signaling targets and the growth promoter Myc.

  {"id":"tie2014","abstract":"Trithorax (TRX) antagonizes epigenetic silencing by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, stimulates enhancer-dependent transcription, and establishes a ‘cellular memory’ of active transcription of PcG-regulated genes. The mechanisms underlying these TRX functions remain largely unknown, but are presumed to involve its histone H3K4 methyltransferase activity. We report that the SET domains of TRX and TRX-related (TRR) have robust histone H3K4 monomethyltransferase activity in vitro and that Tyr3701 of TRX and Tyr2404 of TRR prevent them from being trimethyltransferases. The trxZ11 missense mutation (G3601S), which abolishes H3K4 methyltransferase activity in vitro, reduces the H3K4me1 but not the H3K4me3 level in vivo. trxZ11 also suppresses the impaired silencing phenotypes of the Pc3 mutant, suggesting that H3K4me1 is involved in antagonizing Polycomb silencing. Polycomb silencing is also antagonized by TRX-dependent H3K27 acetylation by CREB-binding protein (CBP). We show that perturbation of Polycomb silencing by TRX overexpression requires CBP. We also show that TRX and TRR are each physically associated with CBP in vivo, that TRX binds directly to the CBP KIX domain, and that the chromatin binding patterns of TRX and TRR are highly correlated with CBP and H3K4me1 genome-wide. In vitro acetylation of H3K27 by CBP is enhanced on K4me1-containing H3 substrates, and independently altering the H3K4me1 level in vivo, via the H3K4 demethylase LSD1, produces concordant changes in H3K27ac. These data indicate that the catalytic activities of TRX and CBP are physically coupled and suggest that both activities play roles in antagonizing Polycomb silencing, stimulating enhancer activity and cellular memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Tie","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Rakhee"},{"family":"Saiakhova","given":"Alina R."},{"family":"Howard","given":"Benny"},{"family":"Monteith","given":"Kelsey E."},{"family":"Scacheri","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Cosgrove","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Harte","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"tie2014","container-title":"Development","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.102392","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,1]]},"page":"1129-1139","source":"Silverchair","title":"Trithorax monomethylates histone H3K4 and interacts directly with CBP to promote H3K27 acetylation and antagonize Polycomb silencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.102392","volume":"141"},

Mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference is used extensively as well. In the fly, exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses. However, the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or RNA interference is started. Targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Here we demonstrate that the auxin-inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in Drosophila melanogaster. Neither auxin nor TIR1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism, and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin-inducible degron.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Trost","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Blattner","given":"Ariane C."},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Christian F."}],"citation-key":"trost2016","container-title":"Fly","DOI":"10.1080/19336934.2016.1168552","ISSN":"1933-6934","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,2]]},"page":"35-46","PMID":"27010248","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Regulated protein depletion by the auxin-inducible degradation system in Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2016.1168552","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"trotman2021","abstract":"The polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRCs; PRC1 and PRC2) are conserved histone-modifying enzymes that often function cooperatively to repress gene expression. The PRCs are regulated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in complex ways. On the one hand, specific lncRNAs cause the PRCs to engage with chromatin and repress gene expression over genomic regions that can span megabases. On the other hand, the PRCs bind RNA with seemingly little sequence specificity, and at least in the case of PRC2, direct RNA-binding has the effect of inhibiting the enzyme. Thus, some RNAs appear to promote PRC activity, while others may inhibit it. The reasons behind this apparent dichotomy are unclear. The most potent PRC-activating lncRNAs associate with chromatin and are predominantly unspliced or harbor unusually long exons. Emerging data imply that these lncRNAs promote PRC activity through internal RNA sequence elements that arise and disappear rapidly in evolutionary time. These sequence elements may function by interacting with common subsets of RNA-binding proteins that recruit or stabilize PRCs on chromatin.

In\n              Drosophila\n              and other insects, ecdysone coordinates developmental transitions, including wholesale transformation of the larva into the adult during metamorphosis. Like other hormones, ecdysone controls gene expression through a nuclear receptor, which functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Although it is clear that ecdysone elicits distinct transcriptional responses within its different target tissues, the role of its receptor, EcR, in regulating target gene expression is incompletely understood. In particular, EcR initiates a cascade of transcription factor expression in response to ecdysone, making it unclear which ecdysone-responsive genes are direct EcR targets. Here, we use the larval-to-prepupal transition of developing wings to examine the role of EcR in gene regulation. Genome-wide DNA binding profiles reveal that EcR exhibits widespread binding across the genome, including at many canonical ecdysone response genes. However, the majority of its binding sites reside at genes with wing-specific functions. We also find that EcR binding is temporally dynamic, with thousands of binding sites changing over time. RNA-seq reveals that EcR acts as both a temporal gate to block precocious entry to the next developmental stage as well as a temporal trigger to promote the subsequent program. Finally, transgenic reporter analysis indicates that EcR regulates not only temporal changes in target enhancer activity but also spatial patterns. Together, these studies define EcR as a multipurpose, direct regulator of gene expression, greatly expanding its role in coordinating developmental transitions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Uyehara","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"McKay","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"uyehara2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1900343116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,14]]},"language":"en","page":"9893-9902","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Direct and widespread role for the nuclear receptor EcR in mediating the response to ecdysone in <i>Drosophila</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900343116","volume":"116"},

The field expanded upon the work initiated by Herman Muller in 1926 when he used X-rays to develop the first balancer chromosomes. Today, balancers are still invaluable to maintain mutations and transgenes but the arsenal of tools has expanded vastly and numerous new methods have been developed, many relying on the availability of the genome sequence and transposable elements. Forward genetic screens based on chemical mutagenesis or transposable elements have resulted in the unbiased identification of many novel players involved in processes probed by specific phenotypic assays. Reverse genetic approaches have relied on the availability of a carefully selected set of transposon insertions spread throughout the genome to allow the manipulation of the region in the vicinity of each insertion. Lastly, the ability to transform Drosophila with single copy transgenes using transposons or site-specific integration using the ΦC31 integrase has allowed numerous manipulations, including the ability to create and integrate genomic rescue constructs, generate duplications, RNAi knock-out technology, binary expression systems like the GAL4/UAS system as well as other methods.

In neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease, the crucial role of YY1 in cellular processes in the central nervous system is further underscored. In this mini-review, we discuss the various mechanisms leading to the transcriptional activating and repressing roles of YY1, including its role as a traditional transcription factor, its interactions with cofactors and chromatin modifiers, the role of YY1 in the non-coding genome and 3D chromatin organization and the possible implications of the phase-separation mechanism on YY1 function. We provide examples on how these processes can be involved in normal development and how alterations can lead to various diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Verheul","given":"Thijs C.

  {"id":"vincenzopirrotta2017","abstract":"Abstract   The PRC2 complex is well known or producing H3K27me3, associated with silenced Polycomb target genes. However, the predominant activity of PRC2 produces H3K27me2 in an untargeted, genome-wide, hit-and-run mode that methylates 60–70% of all histone H3. The level of H3K27me2 is correlated with low or absent transcriptional activity. Inactivation of PRC2 leads to loss of H3K27me2, global increase in H3K27ac and H3K4me1, and transcriptional activation. Transcriptional activity increases in proportion to the previous levels of H3K27me2 but even highly transcribed genes increase two- to fourfold. These effects indicate that PRC2 is a very dynamic, untargeted modifier of genomic chromatin that operates in constant antagonism with H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 monomethylation. This chapter reviews the evidence for a chromatin surveillance mechanism that restricts access to genomic DNA while allowing transient access to DNA binding proteins and the possibility of stable opening of gene regulatory regions. Functional and evolutionary relationships to PRC1 activities are examined.","author":[{"literal":"Vincenzo Pirrotta"}],"citation-key":"vincenzopirrotta2017","DOI":"10.1016/b978-0-12-809737-3.00013-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title":"Global Functions of PRC2 Complexes","type":"article-journal"},

At the same time, they orchestrate the varieties of signals from other cells, from growth factors, morphogens, or external stimuli that condition a cell’s response. Polycomb complexes generate two kinds of histone modifications: H2A ubiquitylation and H3K27 methylation, that are thought to serve instructive roles, controlling and targeting the repressive functions. The methylation function also serves as a memory of the previous state of a target gene and is responsible for the epigenetic features of Polycomb repression. Despite the vast amount learned about Polycomb complexes, two key features are still poorly understood: how they are recruited and how they effect repression.

Photobleaching experiments in living cells indicate that receptors transiently interact with DNA on the time scale of seconds and predict that the response elements may be sparsely occupied on average. Here, we show that the binding of one receptor at the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) does not reduce the steady-state binding of another receptor variant to the same GRE. Mathematical simulations reproduce this noncompetitive state using short GR/GRE residency times and relatively long times between DNA binding events. At many genomic sites where GR binding causes increased chromatin accessibility, concurrent steady-state binding levels for the variant receptor are actually increased, a phenomenon termed assisted loading.

This provides a tag that facilitates binding by a Pc-containing complex. In wing imaginal discs, these PcG proteins also are present at discrete locations at or downstream of the promoter of a silenced target gene, Ubx. E(z)-dependent H3mK27 is also present near the Ubx promoter and is needed for Pc binding.

Although SCM can interact with Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in vitro, biochemical studies have indicated that SCM is not a core constituent of PRC1 or PRC2. Nevertheless, SCM is just as critical for Drosophila Hox gene silencing as canonical subunits of these well-characterized PcG complexes. To address functional relationships between SCM and other PcG components, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation studies using cultured Drosophila Schneider line 2 (S2) cells and larval imaginal discs. We find that SCM associates with a Polycomb response element (PRE) upstream of the Ubx gene which also binds PRC1, PRC2, and the DNA-binding PcG protein Pleiohomeotic (PHO). However, SCM is retained at this Ubx PRE despite genetic disruption or knockdown of PHO, PRC1, or PRC2, suggesting that SCM chromatin targeting does not require prior association of these other PcG components. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (IPs) to test the consequences of SCM genetic disruption or knockdown revealed that PHO association is unaffected, but reduced levels of PRE-bound PRC2 and PRC1 were observed. We discuss these results in light of current models for recruitment of PcG complexes to chromatin targets.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Liangjun"},{"family":"Jahren","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Ellen L."},{"family":"Ketel","given":"Carrie S."},{"family":"Mallin","given":"Daniel R."},{"family":"Simon","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"citation-key":"wang2010","container-title":"Molecular and Cellular Biology","container-title-short":"Mol Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1128/MCB.01451-09","ISSN":"1098-5549","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"2584-2593","PMCID":"PMC2876513","PMID":"20351181","source":"PubMed","title":"Comparative analysis of chromatin binding by Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) and other polycomb group repressors at a Drosophila Hox gene","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"wojtovich2014","abstract":"Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are known to cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. In addition, recent evidence suggests that ROS can also initiate signaling cascades that respond to stress and modify specific redox-sensitive moieties as a regulatory mechanism. This suggests that ROS are physiologically-relevant signaling molecules. However, these sensor/effector molecules are not uniformly distributed throughout the cell. Moreover, localized ROS damage may elicit site-specific compensatory measures. Thus, the impact of ROS can be likened to that of calcium, a ubiquitous second messenger, leading to the prediction that their effects are exquisitely dependent upon their location, quantity and even the timing of generation. Despite this prediction, ROS signaling is most commonly intuited through the global administration of chemicals that produce ROS or by ROS quenching through global application of antioxidants. Optogenetics, which uses light to control the activity of genetically-encoded effector proteins, provides a means of circumventing this limitation. Photo-inducible genetically-encoded ROS-generating proteins (RGPs) were originally employed for their phototoxic effects and cell ablation. However, reducing irradiance and/or fluence can achieve sub-lethal levels of ROS that may mediate subtle signaling effects. Hence, transgenic expression of RGPs as fusions to native proteins gives researchers a new tool to exert spatial and temporal control over ROS production.

In order to further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this striking phenomenon, two key questions must be answered: when and how old and new histones are differentially incorporated by sister chromatids, and how epigenetically distinct sister chromatids are specifically recognized and segregated.

PCP is established through interactions of the core Frizzled (Fz)/PCP factors and, although their molecular interactions are beginning to be understood, the upstream input providing the directional bias and polarity axis remains unknown. Among core PCP genes, Fz is unique as it regulates PCP both cell-autonomously and non-autonomously, with its extracellular domain acting as a ligand for Van Gogh (Vang). We demonstrate in Drosophila melanogaster wings that Wg (Wingless) and dWnt4 (Drosophila Wnt homologue) provide instructive regulatory input for PCP axis determination, establishing polarity axes along their graded distribution and perpendicular to their expression domain borders. Loss-of-function studies reveal that Wg and dWnt4 act redundantly in PCP determination. They affect PCP by modulating the intercellular interaction between Fz and Vang, which is thought to be a key step in setting up initial polarity, thus providing directionality to the PCP process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Roman","given":"Angel-Carlos"},{"family":"Carvajal-Gonzalez","given":"Jose Maria"},{"family":"Mlodzik","given":"Marek"}],"citation-key":"wu2013","container-title":"Nature Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/ncb2806","ISSN":"1476-4679","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"language":"en","license":"2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

More recent evidence suggests that a subset of PcG proteins engages in transcriptional activation in some cellular contexts, but how this property is exerted remains largely unknown. Here, we generated ES cells with single or combined disruption of polycomb group RING finger protein 3 (Pcgf3) and Pcgf5 with the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. We report that although these mutant cells maintained their self-renewal and colony-forming capacity, they displayed severe defects in mesoderm differentiation in vitro and in vivo Using RNA-seq to analyze transcriptional profiles of ES cells with single or combined Pcgf3/5 deficiencies, we found that in contrast to the canonical role of the related polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in gene repression, Pcgf3/5 mainly function as transcriptional activators driving expression of many genes involved in mesoderm differentiation. Proteomic approaches and promoter occupancy analyses helped to establish an extended Pcgf3/5 interactome and identified several novel Pcgf3/5 interactors. These included testis-expressed 10 (Tex10), which may directly contribute to transcriptional activation via the transcriptional co-activator p300. Furthermore, Pcgf3/5 deletion in ES cells substantially reduced the occupancy of Tex10 and p300 at target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that Pcgf3/5 are essential for regulating global levels of the histone modifier H2AK119ub1 in ES cells. Our findings establish Pcgf3/5 as transcriptional activators that interact with Tex10 and p300 in ES cells and point to redundant activity of Pcgf3/5 in pluripotency maintenance.","author":[{"literal":"Wukui Zhao"},{"literal":"Yikai Huang"},{"literal":"Jingzi Zhang"},{"literal":"Mengjie Liu"},{"literal":"Haijing Ji"},{"literal":"Congcong Wang"},{"literal":"Ning Cao"},{"literal":"Chao-Jun Li"},{"literal":"Chaojun Li"},{"literal":"Chaojun Li"},{"literal":"Yin Xia"},{"literal":"Qing Jiang"},{"literal":"Jinzhong Qin"}],"citation-key":"wukuizhao2017","container-title":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","container-title-short":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","DOI":"10.1074/jbc.m117.804054","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title":"Polycomb group RING finger proteins 3/5 activate transcription via an interaction with the pluripotency factor Tex10 in embryonic stem cells","type":"article-journal"},

However, little is known about the precise mechanisms of differently composed noncanonical PRC1 in the maintenance of the pluripotent cell state. Here we disrupt the Pcgf genes in mouse embryonic stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 and find Pcgf6 null embryonic stem cells display severe defects in self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, Pcgf6 regulates genes mostly involved in differentiation and spermatogenesis by assembling a noncanonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6. Notably, Pcgf6 deletion causes a dramatic decrease in PRC1.6 binding to target genes and no loss of H2AK119ub1. Thus, Pcgf6 is essential for recruitment of PRC1.6 to chromatin.

TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than two-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by ten-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between enhancer-promoter contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of enhancer-promoter biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries. It also offers a mechanism to reconcile apparently contradictory results from recent global TAD disruption with local TAD boundary deletion experiments.

BRCA1 functions in multiple biological processes, including double-strand break repair, replication stress suppression, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin reorganization. While non-malignant cells carrying cancer-predisposing BRCA1 mutations exhibit increased genomic instability, it remains unclear whether BRCA1 haploinsufficiency affects transcription and chromatin dynamics in breast epithelial cells. H3K27ac-associated super-enhancers were compared in primary breast epithelial cells from BRCA1 mutation carriers (BRCA1mut/+) and non-carriers (BRCA1+/+). Non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells with engineered BRCA1 haploinsufficiency were used to confirm the H3K27ac changes. The impact of BRCA1 mutations on enhancer function and enhancer-promoter looping was assessed in MCF10A cells. Here, we show that primary mammary epithelial cells from women with BRCA1 mutations display significant loss of H3K27ac-associated super-enhancers. These BRCA1-dependent super-enhancers are enriched with binding motifs for the GATA family. Non-tumorigenic BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells recapitulate the H3K27ac loss. Attenuated histone mark and enhancer activity in these BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells can be partially restored with wild-type BRCA1. Furthermore, chromatin conformation analysis demonstrates impaired enhancer-promoter looping in BRCA1mut/+ MCF10A cells. H3K27ac-associated super-enhancer loss is a previously unappreciated functional deficiency in ostensibly normal BRCA1 mutation-carrying breast epithelium.

Here, we describe two individuals, each with rare de novo missense variants in RNF2. Their phenotypes include intrauterine growth retardation, severe intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, seizures, feeding difficulties and dysmorphic features. Population genomics data suggest that RNF2 is highly constrained for loss-of-function (LoF) and missense variants, and both p.R70H and p.S82R variants have not been reported to date. Structural analyses of the two alleles indicate that these changes likely impact the interaction between RNF2 and BMI1, another PRC1 subunit, or its substrate Histone H2A, respectively. Finally, we provide functional data in Drosophila that these two missense variants behave as LoF alleles in vivo. The evidence provide support for deleterious alleles in RNF2 being associated with a new and recognizable genetic disorder. This tentative gene-disease association in addition to the 12 previously identified disorders caused by PcG genes attests to the importance of these chromatin regulators in Mendelian disorders.","author":[{"literal":"Xi Luo"},{"literal":"Kelly Schoch"},{"literal":"Sharayu Jangam"},{"literal":"Venkata Hemanjani Bhavana"},{"literal":"Hillary K.

Research in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that specialized Polycomb response elements (PREs) are key for targeting of Drosophila Polycomb complexes. PREs are necessary and sufficient to recruit all Polycomb complexes but they also recruit proteins that counteract Polycomb repression in cells where target genes have to remain active. The ability to simultaneously recruit repressors and antirepressors makes PREs switchable cellular memory modules. PREs comprise flexible combinations of recognition sequences for multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Polycomb complexes cannot bind DNA on their own so these adaptor proteins mediate the recruitment. Most of the PRE-bound adaptor proteins interact with Polycomb complexes weakly. However, their individually weak interactions combine to produce robust recruitment. Such combinatorial recruitment is key for the epigenetic property of the Polycomb system to repress target genes only if they have been repressed during previous cell cycles.","author":[{"literal":"Y.B.

Most of the existing methods for GRN inference rely on gene co-expression analysis or TF-target binding information, where the determination of co-expression is often unreliable merely based on gene expression levels, and the TF-target binding data from high-throughput experiments may be noisy, leading to a high ratio of false links and missed links, especially for large-scale networks. In recent years, the microscopy images recording spatial gene expression have become a new resource in GRN reconstruction, as the spatial and temporal expression patterns contain much abundant gene interaction information. Till now, the spatial expression resources have been largely underexploited, and only a few traditional image processing methods have been employed in the image-based GRN reconstruction. Moreover, co-expression analysis using conventional measurements based on image similarity may be inaccurate, because it is the local-pattern consistency rather than global-image-similarity that determines gene-gene interactions. Here we present GripDL (Gene regulatory interaction prediction via Deep Learning), which incorporates high-confidence TF-gene regulation knowledge from previous studies, and constructs GRNs for Drosophila eye development based on Drosophila embryonic gene expression images.

The classic recruitment model of Polycomb group complexes in which PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation recruits PRC1 for H2A monoubiquitination was recently challenged by data showing that PRC1 activity can also recruit PRC2. However, the prevalence of these two mechanisms is unknown, especially in plants as H2AK121ub marks were examined at only a handful of Polycomb group targets. By using genome-wide analyses, we show that H2AK121ub marks are surprisingly widespread in Arabidopsis thaliana, often co-localizing with H3K27me3 but also occupying a set of transcriptionally active genes devoid of H3K27me3. Furthermore, by profiling H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks in atbmi1a/b/c, clf/swn, and lhp1 mutants we found that PRC2 activity is not required for H2AK121ub marking at most genes.

Initially, the piggyBac transposon was thought to be a rare transposon. This view, however, has now been completely revised as a number of fully sequenced genomes have revealed the presence of piggyBac-like repetitive elements. The isolation of active copies of the piggyBac-like elements from several distinct species further supported this revision. This includes the first isolation of an active mammalian DNA transposon identified in the bat genome. To date, the piggyBac transposon has been deeply characterized and it represents a number of unique characteristics. In general, all members of the piggyBac superfamily use TTAA as their integration target sites. In addition, the piggyBac transposon shows precise excision, i.e., restoring the sequence to its preintegration state, and can transpose in a variety of organisms such as yeasts, malaria parasites, insects, mammals, and even in plants. Biochemical analysis of the chemical steps of transposition revealed that piggyBac does not require DNA synthesis during the actual transposition event.

Short-range DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2)-Notch signaling between D and V cells drives vg expression in `border' cells that flank the boundary. It also induces these same cells to secrete the long-range morphogen Wingless(Wg), which drives vg expression in surrounding cells up to 25-30 cell diameters away. Here, we show that Wg signaling is not sufficient to activate vg expression away from the D-V boundary. Instead, Wg must act in combination with a short-range signal produced by cells that already express vg. We present evidence that this vg-dependent, vg-inducing signal feeds forward from one cell to the next to entrain surrounding cells to join the growing wing primordium in response to Wg.

  {"id":"zecca2021","abstract":"Development of the Drosophila wing—a paradigm of organ development—is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp “equalized” by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding “pre-wing” cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of vestigial (vg)—the selector gene that specifies the wing state—both to sustain vg expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce vg expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zecca","given":"Myriam"},{"family":"Struhl","given":"Gary"}],"citation-key":"zecca2021","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.3001111","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e3001111","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A unified mechanism for the control of Drosophila wing growth by the morphogens Decapentaplegic and Wingless","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001111","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"zheng2019","abstract":"The genomes of multicellular organisms are extensively folded into 3D chromosome territories within the nucleus1. Advanced 3D genome-mapping methods that combine proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing (such as chromosome conformation capture, Hi-C)2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques (such as chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing, ChIA-PET)3, have revealed topologically associating domains4 with frequent chromatin contacts, and have identified chromatin loops mediated by specific protein factors for insulation and regulation of transcription5–7. However, these methods rely on pairwise proximity ligation and reflect population-level views, and thus cannot reveal the detailed nature of chromatin interactions. Although single-cell Hi-C8 potentially overcomes this issue, this method may be limited by the sparsity of data that is inherent to current single-cell assays. Recent advances in microfluidics have opened opportunities for droplet-based genomic analysis9 but this approach has not yet been adapted for chromatin interaction analysis. Here we describe a strategy for multiplex chromatin-interaction analysis via droplet-based and barcode-linked sequencing, which we name ChIA-Drop. We demonstrate the robustness of ChIA-Drop in capturing complex chromatin interactions with single-molecule precision, which has not been possible using methods based on population-level pairwise contacts. By applying ChIA-Drop to Drosophila cells, we show that chromatin topological structures predominantly consist of multiplex chromatin interactions with high heterogeneity; ChIA-Drop also reveals promoter-centred multivalent interactions, which provide topological insights into transcription.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Meizhen"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Simon Zhongyuan"},{"family":"Capurso","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Minji"},{"family":"Maurya","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Byoungkoo"},{"family":"Piecuch","given":"Emaly"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jacqueline Jufen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhihui"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Chee Hong"},{"family":"Ngan","given":"Chew Yee"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Ruan","given":"Xiaoan"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Chia-Lin"},{"family":"Ruan","given":"Yijun"}],"citation-key":"zheng2019","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-0949-1","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7745","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Chromatin structure;Epigenomics\nSubject_term_id: chromatin-structure;epigenomics","number":"7745","page":"558-562","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Multiplex chromatin interactions with single-molecule precision","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0949-1","volume":"566"},

Here we present evidence for the occurrence of cis regulatory elements that control the levels of gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions. For this purpose we have investigated the Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) because genetic studies suggest that the BX-C contains as much as 300 kb of cis regulatory information. A specialized DNA element, Fab-7, has been proposed to function as a boundary element that separates the iab-6 and iab-7 cis regulatory regions within the Abd-B domain of the BX-C. A 1.2-kb Fab-7 DNA fragment was placed between divergently transcribed white and lacZ test promoters and challenged with several defined enhancers expressed in the early embryo. These studies suggest that Fab-7 functions as an attenuator, which weakens gene expression by reducing enhancer-promoter interactions. Fab-7 selectively blocks distal enhancers in an orientation-independent fashion, and can function when located far from either the distal enhancer or target promoter. Fab-7 may be related to insulator DNAs, which flank genetic loci and functionally isolate neighboring genes. We propose that specialized DNA elements, such as the Fab-7 attenuator, might play a general role in controlling the levels of gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"J."},{"family":"Barolo","given":"S."},{"family":"Szymanski","given":"P."},{"family":"Levine","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"zhou1996","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.10.24.3195","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"3195-3201","PMID":"8985187","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genesdev.cshlp.org","title":"The Fab-7 element of the bithorax complex attenuates enhancer-promoter interactions in the Drosophila embryo.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/10/24/3195","volume":"10"},

H2AK119ub1 (H2Aub) and H3K27me3 are catalyzed by Polycomb-repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) respectively, and they largely overlap in the genome due to mutual recruitment of the two complexes. However, it is unclear whether PRC1/H2Aub and PRC2/H3K27me3 can also function independently. By developing an ultra-sensitive carrier-DNA-assisted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing method termed CATCH-Seq, we generated allelic H2Aub profiles in mouse gametes and early embryos. Our results revealed an unexpected genomewide decoupling of H2Aub and H3K27me3 in mouse preimplantation embryos, where H2Aub but not H3K27me3 was enriched at PcG targets while only H3K27me3 was deposited in the broad distal domains associated with DNA methylation-independent non-canonical imprinting. These observations suggest that H2Aub represses future bivalent genes during early embryogenesis without H3K27me3, but it is not required for the maintenance of non-canonical imprinting, which is mediated by maternal H3K27me3.

  {"id":"zhuangzhuanggeng2020","abstract":"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins function as vital epigenetic regulators in various biological processes, including pluripotency, development, and carcinogenesis. PcG proteins form multicomponent complexes, and two major types of protein complexes have been identified in mammals to date, Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). The PRC1 complexes are composed in a hierarchical manner in which the catalytic core, RING1A/B, exclusively interacts with one of six Polycomb group RING finger (PCGF) proteins. This association with specific PCGF proteins allows for PRC1 to be subdivided into six distinct groups, each with their own unique modes of action arising from the distinct set of associated proteins. Historically, PRC1 was considered to be a transcription repressor that deposited monoubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and compacted local chromatin. More recently, there is increasing evidence that demonstrates the transcription activation role of PRC1. Moreover, studies on the higher-order chromatin structure have revealed a new function for PRC1 in mediating long-range interactions. This provides a different perspective regarding both the transcription activation and repression characteristics of PRC1.

  {"id":"zhuozhang2017","abstract":"Posttranslational histone modifications play important roles in regulating chromatin-based nuclear processes. Histone H2AK119 ubiquitination (H2Aub) is a prevalent modification and has been primarily linked to gene silencing. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here we report the identification of RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1), a subunit of the RSF complex, as a H2Aub binding protein, which mediates the gene-silencing function of this histone modification. RSF1 associates specifically with H2Aub, but not H2Bub nucleosomes, through a previously uncharacterized and obligatory region designated as ubiquitinated H2A binding domain. In human and mouse cells, genes regulated by RSF1 overlap significantly with those controlled by RNF2/Ring1B, the subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) which catalyzes the ubiquitination of H2AK119. About 82% of H2Aub-enriched genes, including the classic PRC1 target Hox genes, are bound by RSF1 around their transcription start sites. Depletion of H2Aub levels by Ring1B knockout results in a significant reduction of RSF1 binding. In contrast, RSF1 knockout does not affect RNF2/Ring1B or H2Aub levels but leads to derepression of H2Aub target genes, accompanied by changes in H2Aub chromatin organization and release of linker histone H1. The action of RSF1 in H2Aub-mediated gene silencing is further demonstrated by chromatin-based in vitro transcription. Finally, RSF1 and Ring1 act cooperatively to regulate mesodermal cell specification and gastrulation during Xenopus early embryonic development. Taken together, these data identify RSF1 as a H2Aub reader that contributes to H2Aub-mediated gene silencing by maintaining a stable nucleosome pattern at promoter regions.","author":[{"literal":"Zhuo Zhang"},{"literal":"Amanda Jones"},{"literal":"Wei Wu"},{"literal":"Wei Wu"},{"literal":"Jin-Man Kim"},{"literal":"Yue Kang"},{"literal":"Yue Kang"},{"literal":"Xiaobao Bi"},{"literal":"Xiaobao Bi"},{"literal":"Yue Gu"},{"literal":"Ivan K.

  {"id":"zsuzsannalichner2017","abstract":"Abstract   Context  Regenerative medicine has recently presented a revolutionary solution to end-stage kidney disease. Reprogramming patients’ own cells generates induced pluripotent stem cells that are subsequently differentiated to “kidney organoid,” a structure that is anatomically and functionally similar to the kidney. This approach holds the promise of a transplantable, immunocompetent, and functional kidney that could be produced in vitro. However, caution must be taken due to the molecular-level similarities between induced pluripotent stem cells and renal cell carcinomas. As such, if cell reprogramming is not tightly controlled, it can lead to carcinogenic changes.    Objective  Based on recent next-generation sequencing results and other supporting data, we identified three major molecular attributes of renal cell carcinoma: metabolic alterations, epigenetic changes, and miRNA-based alterations. Strikingly, these variations are mirrored in induced pluripotent stem cells, which are the main cell source of renal regenerative medicine. Our objective was to discuss the shared metabolic, epigenetic and miRNA-regulated characteristics and to abridge their significance in renal regenerative medicine.    Evidence acquisition  English-language literature was retrieved through PubMed.    Evidence synthesis  Authors collected the published evidence and evaluated the content based on independent literature findings. Articles were filtered to include only highly relevant, recent publications that presented reproducible results by authorities of the field.    Conclusions  The kidney represents a unique metabolic environment that could be hijacked by induced pluripotent stem cells or by partially differentiated cells for oncogenic transformation. Future differentiation protocols must produce kidney organoids that are fully engaged in filtration function.    Patient summary  A new technology can produce mini-kidneys or kidney organoids. This review discusses some of the challenges this technology has to face, including its high oncogenic potential. Understanding these similarities will lead to the safe creation of new functional kidney units in patients with kidney failure.","author":[{"literal":"Zsuzsanna Lichner"},{"literal":"Fabrice Mac-Way"},{"literal":"Fabrice Mac-Way"},{"literal":"George M.
